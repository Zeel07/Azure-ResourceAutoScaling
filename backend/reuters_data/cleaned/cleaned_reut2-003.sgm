<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills
maturing in official hands and the treasury bill takeup would
drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers
balances would take out a further 140 mln.
    Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345
mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be
an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SETS MONEY MARKET TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said it invited offers
of first category paper today for a money market intervention
tender.
    Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the
Bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter
percentage point to 73/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing
in call money rate last week, and the French francs steadiness
on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency
stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.
    Intervention rate was last raised to eight pct from 71/4
on January 2. Call money today was quoted at 711/16 73/4 pct.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA DELAYS CONTRACT FOR NUCLEAR PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Technology transfer problems have delayed
the finalising of contracts between South Koreas stateowned
Korea Electric Power Corp Kepco and U.S. Firms for supplies
of equipment and services for Kepcos latest two 950megawatt
nuclear power plants, a Kepco spokesman said.
    He told Reuters the contracts for Kepcos tenth and
eleventh stations, costing between two and three billion dlrs,
were due for completion by the end of February.
    Kepco has been negotiating with Combustion Engineering Inc
CSP for pressurised lightwater reactors and General Electric
Co GE for turbines.

    KEPCO has also been negotiating with Sargent and Lundy
Engineers for engineering and design consultancy services.
    "We have been waging a tugofwar on the transfer of
advanced technology. But I am optimistic we will sign contracts
with them within this month," the spokesman said.
    He said the transfer of advanced technology is vital for
South Korea, which wants to build future nuclear power plants
with its own technology.
    Work on the two plants is due to start about June 1988 for
completion in 1995 and 1996, although the sites have yet to be
chosen, he said.

<TITLE>NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK CUTS BASE RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>National Westminster Bank Plc said it has
cut its base lending rate  0.5 percentage points to 10.5 pct
today.
    National Westminster said that it was responding to general
easing in money market rates.
    Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier
this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the
base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last
week that such a move would be premature.
    However, since then the pound has continued to gain
strongly.

<TITLE>U.S. TO ALLOW TEMPORARY IMPORTS OF S.A. URANIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury Department said it would
temporarily permit imports of South African uranium ore and
oxide pending clarification of antiapartheid sanctions laws
passed by Congress last fall.
    The decision was announced late Friday. It applies, until
July 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the U.S. for
processing and reexport to third countries.
    The Treasury said it took the action because it felt that
when Congress passed the comprehensive South African sanctions
bill last fall over President Reagans veto it had not intended
to hurt U.S. industry.
    In addition, the Treasury said it would permit U.S.made
goods to be imported temporarily from South African
statecontrolled organizations for repair or servicing.

scandal is expected to bring indictments that could include
felony charges against senior Reagan administration officials,
the New York Times reported.
    It quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of the
investigation as saying special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who
is investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.
    The paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud the
government, obstructing justice and making false statements to
the government. It said the prosecutor had not ruled out any
suspects, including current and former government officials.

<TITLE>NYSE RULE COULD AFFECT TRADING IN LONDON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>An existing New York Stock Exchange,
NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of its
members in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sources
at the London Exchange said.
    This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes ahead
with plans to close its trading floor.
    The London Exchange sources were commenting on press
reports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from trading
on the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periods
when the NYSE was open.
    The London exchange is seeking clarification.
    London Exchange sources said the possibility of
restrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule which
requires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess a
trading floor.
    Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that it
planned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floor
for traded options, because almost all business is now being
done by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.
    This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring of
the market on October 27. The demise of the traditional Stock
Exchange floor has been widely expected, though no date has
been set as yet.
    Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule could
well be reached, partly because the interests of U.S.
Securities dealers are not all identical.
    Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointing
out, among other things, that the expansion of global trading
needs to be based on reciprocal arrangements.
    NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the London
Exchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage over
nonNYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the London
Exchange, market sources said.

<TITLE>PIEDMONT ltPIE> AGREES TO USAIR ltU> BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said Piedmont Aviation
Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmonts
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmonts consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmonts stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
    Last week, Carl C. Icahncontrolled Trans World Airlines
Inc ltTWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
    The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWAs
application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
application failed to comply with department regulations by
omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile
today, providing the information needed.
    On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares
or 15 pct of USAir.

<TITLE>U.S. AIDES SEE MOSCOW AGREEING TO ARMS CHECK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Arms control officials
said they were optimistic the United States and Soviet Union
could reach agreement on ways to verify a pact to eliminate
mediumrange nuclear missiles in Europe.
    Chief U.S. Arms control negotiator Max Kampelman said on
the NBC television network a fair pact would be hard to
negotiate, but, "We are determined to do it."
    Assistant Secretary of Defence for international security
policy Richard Perle said he thought the two sides could agree
on a method to ensure each side was honouring a missile pact.
    President Reagan said on Friday that Secretary of State
George Shultz would go to Moscow next month for talks on arms
control and a possible U.S.Soviet summit meeting.
    The decision to send Shultz to Moscow followed an
announcement by Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev that he was
willing to separate elimination of mediumrange missiles in
Europe from his demand for curbs on U.S. Development of a
Strategic Defence Initiative SDI antimissile system.
    Kampelman said the United States and the Soviet Union both
had a general definition of socalled "intrusive" or onsite
inspection of a pact, but details would be tough to work out.

<TITLE>OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The 24 nations of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development OECD, hampered by
sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit EIU  said.
    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
hit by currency appreciation this year.
    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
dlrs a barrel by end1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
increasingly ragged.
    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
tradeweighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
years 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at
1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate
is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollars steeper
angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
rather than a threepoint landing," the EIU said.
    "Talking will not stop the dollars slide for long and the
February meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
Canada produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
U.S. Fsical policy," it said.
    It said the key to the dollars fortunes was the
willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding
that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar
would collapse.
    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
crisis, it said.
    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
"increasingly sick."
    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
December, the EIU said.
    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
Japans exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
competitivelypriced dollar.
    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.

<TITLE>POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE  SOURCES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson and Antonia Sharpe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
similar move, banking sources said.
    The sources were reporting Poehls remarks at a symposium
in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
representatives were not invited.
    The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
    "It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," said
one banker who attended the symposium.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
    But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
identified, Poehls comments were seen by bankers present as a
direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
    "He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"
the second source said.
    In reply to questions, Poehl also said the halfpoint cut
in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
a move in advance, the sources said.
    Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by
cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
"No, they wouldnt have been. We checked that."
    The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
    Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
between central banks before and after the G6 meeting, saying
that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
    For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
    The sources said the tone of Poehls comments boosted
growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
current levels by international central bank cooperation.
    One source said Poehls remarks also underlined the fact
that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
West Germanys economic growth.
    Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
stressed that the German central bank had no direct
responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
combatting inflation.
    This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
halfpoint cut in rates in late January.
    The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
    Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbanks
main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
71/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
    Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
dealers reporting that Poehls remarks, coupled with a bullish
outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,
brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA REVEALS DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE DETAILS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 8  </DATELINE><BODY>The 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling
accord Venezuela signed a week ago will reduce its payments
over the next three years by 64 pct, according to Finance
Ministry figures released this weekend.
    A ministry statistical analysis said while the original
accord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987
and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35
billion over the same period. In 1987, Venezuela will be
required to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billion
originally agreed. Payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from
1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion.
    The ministrys analysis said the reduction in debt
servicing during 19871989 amounts to an effective grace
period, something the Venezuelan negotiators sought from
creditor banks but were not granted.
    Most of the rescheduling falls during 19941998, when 53.3
pct, or some 11.25 billion dlrs, must be paid. Under the
February 27 accord, Venezuela will repay 20.3 billion dlrs of
public sector debt over 14 years at 7/8 of a percentage point
over London interbank offered rates Libor.
    This compares with the February 1986 accord which called
for a 12year term and interest of 11/8 point over Libor.

<TITLE>SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD ltCAW></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>ltMTS Acquisition Corp>, a company
formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of Caesars 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is Caesars largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvanias Pocono
Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc ltCJN>,
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc ltMM> has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc ltPWJ>,
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.
    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of ltAtalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting  including the election
or removal of directors.

<TITLE>DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch economic growth is slowing as a
firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries
reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning
agency CPB said.
    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic
outlook, said Dutch Net National Income NNI was expected to
grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in
1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.
    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20
billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase
from last years 423.95 billion.
    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of
the guilder on a tradeweighted basis compared with 10.0 pct
last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average
of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.
    "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit
labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while
these are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.
    More of economic growth now depended on domestic
consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set
by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on
purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.
    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the
CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.
    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five
pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last
year, the CPB said.
    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to
condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent
years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of
these factors on Dutch competitiveness.
    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social
security costs to employers.
    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2
pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,
urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down
the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in
future.
    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by
falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.
    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this
year from 710,000 last year.
    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is
within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two
pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.
    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in
its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant
prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts
had expected the CPBs final forecast to be below its own
latest estimate.
    "It is too early to comment because I havent seen the whole
document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some
of our estimates," a Pierson economist said.
    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in
1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy
exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.
    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with
four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.
    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the
surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1
billion last year, the CPB forecast.

<TITLE>IOMEGA ltIOMG> SETS MANAGEMENT, LABOR LAYOFFS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROY, Utah, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Iomega Corp said it has laid off over
a quarter of its professional and management staff and nearly
half of its direct labor force as part of a restructuring and
downsizing of its business.
    The company also said it will receive a qualified opinion
from the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to the
outcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in a
consolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in an
unspecified amount and is also a defendant in a related
shareholder action.
    Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter that
both actions are in the early stages of discovery and the
likely outcome can not be determined at this time.
    The company said a corporate wide reduction of its
professional, management and indirect labor will result in the
permanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areas
of the companys business. This represents over 25 pct of
professional, management and indirect employees, it added.
    In addition, Iomega announced layoff of about 182
employees, principally from its manufacturing direct labor
force. Those affected represent about 46 pct of direct labor.
    Commenting on the layoffs, Iomega said those from among the
direct labor force affects personnel building the Alpha Eight
Inch Disk Drive and Bernoulli Boxes.
    "This action is required as we bring our finished goods
inventory and inventory in our distribution channels down to
acceptable levels," it explained.
    The company stated this layoff does not affect the
production of its new 51/4 inch Beta 20 product which is
currently being built to a backlog of orders.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Groundbreaking new systems for storing
and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for
computer companies and computer users.
    Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines
Corp ltIBM>, Eastman Kodak Co ltEK> and others have launched
products that radically increase the amount of data that can be
catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.
    "This flurry of new technology could yield systems that
handle a multimedia blitz of data," said Ian Warhaftig, a
senior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.
    "Were developing new systems because our customers are
asking for them," Peter Giles, vice president and general
manager of Kodaks mass memory division, said in a recent
interview.
    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While
estimates vary, industry analysts project that providing
products and services geared for information storage and
retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by
1995.
    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the
varying requirements of users.
    For example, a large credit verification service would want
a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and
relay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a
computerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,
is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability
to store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be
crucial.
    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward
converting information  documents, video or film or even sound
recordings  into to the digital language of zeros and ones
understood by computers.
    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for
storage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk
can store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of
typewritten text.
    For this reason, the compact disk readonly memory, or
CDROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,
Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program
that contains, on a single CDROM disk, a dictionary,
thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartletts Familiar
Quotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.
    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most
are specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corps ltLOTS>
CDROM data base of stock information for financial analysts
and investors. "Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it
marks the arrival of CDROM packages for the general public,"
said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.
    One drawback of the CDROM, which uses a laser to record
and read data, is that that it requires a special player.
CDROM players for the retail market will appear later this
year.
    Moreover, IDCs Warhaftig said CDROMs will be integrated
with personal computers.
    "Eventually, CDROMs will fit right inside the PC box," he
said. "Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and
thesaurus at your fingertips when youre writing with a word
processing program."
    But CDROMs are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak
unveiled several systems that use 12inch optical disks. The
largest Kodak system uses a jukeboxlike cabinet to hold up to
150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter
of seconds.
    Kodak also announced a 14inch optical disk with 6.8
gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CDROM. The
Kodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of
1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large
amounts of data, said Kodaks Giles.
    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips ltPGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics
giant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step
further with the first disk that can combine text, video and
sound. Philips said the system, called Called CDInteractive,
will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CDROM
player that can hook up with a television set and stereo.
     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next
generation of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month
IBM said it has made a fourmegabyte chip, capable of storing
more data than eight CDROMs. Meantime, ltNippon Telegraph and
Telephone> of Japan said it has built a 16megabyte chip.
    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several
years away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume
production of its fourmegabyte chip sometime this year.
    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers
with immense memory capacities.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE DESPITE COURT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Hundreds of marines were on alert
at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain
on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court
Saturday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners
have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.
    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the
workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our
protest until the end," a union leader said.
 more
    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines
take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and
let the marines handle the situation by themselves.
    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to
send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister
Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national
security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has
cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.
    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their
shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two
stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.

<TITLE>BANKING TRADE GROUP SAYS BANK PROFITS DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The American Bankers Association said
the profitability of the nations commercial banks declined by
12 pct during the first three quarters of 1986.
    During the first nine months of last year, the industrys
annualized rate of return on assets dropped to 0.68 pct from
0.77 pct in the same period in 1985, the ABA said. Return on
equity fell to 10.8 pct from 12.3 pct the previous year.
    Despite the decline in profits, the ABA said banks capital
grew boosting the industrys capital ratio to 6.4 pct from 6.3
pct.
    The number and size of banks losing money during the period
increased significantly, the ABA said.
    During the first nine months of 1986, 17.5 pct of banks,
holding 9.6 pct of banking assets, were unprofitable, the group
said. That compares with 13 pct of banks, holding 8.8 pct of
assets, during the same period in 1985, it said.
    The industrys provisions for loan losses increased to 0.73
pct of assets during the period, up from 0.59 pct of assets
during the same period in 1985, the group said.

<TITLE>PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN 87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The American Paper Institute said the
industry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,
with linerboard particularly strong.
    "A progrowth trade policy, continued attention to currency
management, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax
increases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," Red
Cavaney, American Paper Institute president said.
    Cavaney said that so far this year the industrys
performance mimics last years strength.
    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a
record 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985s 67 mln tons, while
industry aftertax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.
    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in
this years performance.
    "Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive
factor in the industrys outlook this year," he said, citing
market pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at
the low end of the industrys long term average.
    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in
1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as
a whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.
    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be
strong, spurred by consumer spending.
    The benefits of tax reform on individual aftertax income
and consumer goods companies cash flow, he said, will increase
demand for both communications paper and packaging this year.
    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support
high levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for
many kinds of packaged goods.
    Inventory building should help demand for cartons and
corrugated containers this year, he added.
    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in
1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar
against major world currencies.
    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade
in 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial
activity at home and thus higher packaging demand.
    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower
costs, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also
contribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.
    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986
could have a negative impact on the industry this year.
    "For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax
credit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.
    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three
billion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result
of reforms.
    "Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful
evaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending
decisions of individual companies," Cavaney said.

<TITLE>BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany takes "very seriously" the
recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
    Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
for stabilising currencies.
    But he noted the official communique said the participants
agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
rates around current levels. "Were taking this sentence very
seriously," he said.
    Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
the mark since the meeting.
    He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
agreement should help in this respect.
    Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
had not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.
    Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
economic situation in the 12nation bloc.
    The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
country to stimulate economic activity.
    Schlecht said the upturn in West Germanys economy slowed
in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
    He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a
recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up
slightly during the course of the year.

<TITLE>UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Uganda, Africas second largest coffee
producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee
talks in London, the chairman of the staterun Coffee Marketing
Board, CMB, said.
    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a
situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of
robusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on
Friday.
    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula
to share the worlds coffee production during International
Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.
    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were
suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its
quota be increased dramatically.
    Uganda  which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from
coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings 
had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln
60kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.
    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25
pct in the current 1986/87 OctoberSeptember season to over
three mln bags.
    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO
export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.
    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for
about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs
over half of salaried manpower.
    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzanias Agriculture and Livestock
Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World
countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee
talks.
    "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.
    Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within
two months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegations
have had time to report back to their headquarters, common
sense will prevail."

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By WALKER SIMON, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The suspension of Ecuadors crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to twothirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC, was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day bpd of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one months imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The countrys
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
coordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<TITLE>RENAULT, CHRYSLER IN ACCORD FOR CHRYSLER TO BUY AMC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Regie Nationale des Usines Renault
ltRENA.PA> said it and Chrysler Corp ltC> have signed a letter of
intent in which Chrysler plans to buy American Motors Corp
ltAMO.N>, 46 pct owned by Renault.
    Renault President Raymond Levy said in a statement issued
by the French state car group the agreement was an important
stage in Renaults redeployment. "It will allow Renault to
continue its export programme to the U.S. And also opens a
perspective of cooperation with a major American constructor,"
the statement said. Under the terms of the letter of intent,
Chrysler will purchase Renaults stake held in the form of
bonds and shares.
    The Renault statement quoted Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
as saying, "We welcome AMC shareholders into the Chrysler
family."
    He added that the accord would allow Renault and Chrysler
to study the development of future products destined to be
distributed by Renault and Chrysler in the North American and
world markets.
    "Renault is a leader in our industry and I am happy to be
working with them," Iacocca was quoted as saying.
    Chrysler will pay for Renaults AMC interests held in bonds
by a 200 mln dlr bond and will pay up to 350 mln dlrs for
Renault share interests, depending on AMC sales and future
profits, the Renault statement said.
    The statement said the agreement in principle gave each
side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval
would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC
boards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government
authorities.
    If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC
shareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares
for each of their shares valued at four dlrs.
    AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will
have the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on
the same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging
them for AMC shares.

<TITLE>SOUTHERN ltSO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Southern Co said it will take an
aftertax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
in Georgia will be asked to pay.
    The companys largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
last year to Georgias Public Service Commission, the increased
cost will not be included in the utilitys retail electric
rates.
    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
completion of Vogtles Unit Two to June 1989 from September
1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
One and the unit is being put through a series of lowpower
tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
fullpower license.
    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
coowned by ltOglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
due to several factors, including additional labor costs
incurred to keep the plants first unit on schedule for
commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
first change in the plants budget since August 1985, when it
was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
at 3.56 billion dlrs, the companys share of the then projected
8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
    Noting that Georgia Powers share of the Vogtle increase is
313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
    In addition, the company said, Georgia Powers contracts
with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plants
initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
that applies to the buybacks.
    This bings the total amount that must be charged against
earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
    Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
against earnings once that determination is made.
    The company also said its board has approved a capital
budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
Vogtle project.
    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the threeyear
period 19871989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
19861988.

<TITLE>JAPAN EXIM BANK SAYS NO NEW COMMITMENTS TO BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>ExportImport Bank of Japan president
Takashi Tanaka told Brazil the bank will continue to cooperate
with it, but he refrained from making any commitment to a new
credit, ExIm officials said.
    In a 30minute meeting, Tanaka told Brazilian Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro the bank would consider his countrys
request for a 300 mln dlr credit in the context of
international cooperation, the officials said.
    They said this meant the ExIm Bank would grant the credit
as part of a package with money from the International Monetary
Fund and private banks.
    Brazil has resisted going to the IMF for help because it
fears that the Fund will ask for changes in its economic
policies that will throw it into recession.
    Brazil first requested the 300 mln dlr credit last
November, to help it develop the sale and generation of
electric power. Funaro renewed the request today.

<TITLE>OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The 24 nations of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development OECD, hampered by
sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit EIU  said.
    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
hit by currency appreciation this year.
    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
dlrs a barrel by end1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
increasingly ragged.
    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
tradeweighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
years 18.4 pct drop.
    The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollars steeper angle
of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
than a threepoint landing," the EIU said.
    "Talking will not stop the dollars slide for long and the
February meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
Canada produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
U.S. Fiscal policy," it said.
    It said the key to the dollars fortunes was the
willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding that
if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
collapse.
    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
crisis, it said.
    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly
sick."
    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
December, the EIU said.
    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
Japans exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
competitivelypriced dollar.
    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
    However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
the current OECD average of three pct. Nonoil commodity prices
will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
time since 1984, the EIU said.
    After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.
    It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6
pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE CUTS INTERVENTION RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said it cut its money
market intervention rate to 73/4 pct from eight pct when it
injected money against first category paper.
    The bank also cut its sevenday repossession rate to 81/2
pct from 83/4 pct.
    The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was
raised from 71/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came
under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11.
    The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five
pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing
between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills
maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989.
    The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a
money market intervention tender earlier today.
    Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a
quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call
money rate last week, and the French francs steadiness on
foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency
stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.

<TITLE>CONTINENTAL BANK/CANADA SETS DISTRIBUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Bank of Canada, a subsidiary
of Lloyds Bank PLC ltLLOY.L>, said it intends to redeem all
existing preferred shares and distribute a stock dividend to
common shareholders.
    The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable
retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II,
which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive
12.75 dlrs for each share.
    Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding
preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends.
     Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of
72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at
12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive
cash to do so.
    The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in
early May, subject to various approvals.
    Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of
more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs,
allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per
common share.
    Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final
distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs
to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or
early 1989.
    Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular
dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred
shares, the bank said.
    The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank
of Canadas sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a

of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally
anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain

<TITLE>STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9   </DATELINE><BODY>A free trade pact between the United
States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides
substantially, according to a study released by the Institute
for International Economics.
    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion
to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canadas
gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.
exports by about seven pct.
    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of
government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and
investments and pave the way for new global talks under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    The United States and Canada  the worlds two biggest
trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150
billion dlrs a year  opened free trade talks last June. They
are aiming for a pact by next October.
    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of
Maryland, said an agreement should include
     Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased
in over a five to 10year period
     Equal access to federal government procurement in the two
countries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"
provisions with a "Buy North America" provision
     Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance
and transportation
     A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor
domestic producers
     A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.
     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the
two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to
2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.
    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.
    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset
subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for
resolution at an early stage.
    Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to the
efficiency of the North American economies and to their
competitiveness in facing overseas producers.
    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian
goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass
production.
    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to
Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large
U.S. gross national product.
    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.Canada pact in such areas
as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission
could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write
new and more liberal global trading regulations.

<TITLE>U.K. AGRICULTURAL FUTURES MARKETS TO MERGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Three London markets which trade potato,
soymeal and meat futures said they will merge to form a new
Agricultural Futures Exchange.
    Legal advisers have been instructed to implement the
amalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, LPFA,
the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, and the Grain and Feed
Trade Associations, GAFTA, Soya Bean Meal Futures Association,
SOMFA. No timetable was given.
    Members of the three exchanges have been consulted,
Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told
Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger.
    Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange
could ultimately combine five markets.
    Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International
Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain
Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the
other markets, market officials said.
    The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the
merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members
are consulted at a meeting on March 16.
    The grain futures market also intends to consult its
members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said.
    The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and
administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under
the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a
futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE,
for trading to continue.
    Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic
Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE
structure since the beginning of the year.
    The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities
and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE "at the
appropriate time," the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.
    "This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be
made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the
benefit of all those involved in the industry," the chairman of
the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said.
    The merged markets will remain at the Baltic Exchange.

<TITLE>GENCORPltGY> UNIT TO SELL LOS ANGELES TV STATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Gencorp said its RKO General
subsidiary agreed to sell KHJTV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney
Co ltDIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other
adjustments at closing.
    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKOs
application to renew the stations broadcast license would be
dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television
would be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held
Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.
    Renewal of the KHJTV license has been challenged in
regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.
    The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal
Communications Commission, the company said.
    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los
Angeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp ltWX> to
settle the license proceedings and sell KHJTV for 313 mln
dlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the
remainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse
withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.
    In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WORTV in
Secaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc ltMCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has
approved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.
    The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,
according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohiobased Gencorp.
    Fidelity Television originally filed a competing
application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent
station, in 1965.
    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNACTV in
Boston, citing anticompetitive trade practices and inaccurate
financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously
granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,
to be denied.

and last weeks Paris Club debt rescheduling, is likely to
obtain over 100 mln dlrs worth of development aid at a meeting
with donors beginning here tomorrow, John Shilling, director of
the World Banks Moroccan division, said.
    "A certain optimism has appeared in the economy to the
effect that things are no longer impossible and Morocco can get
out of its problems ... We are aiming for 100 mln Special
Drawing Rights and if we can get more it will be put to good
use," he told a news conference.
    The agreement last week with the Paris Club of western
creditors rescheduling over 10 years 900 mln dlrs worth of
official debt due by mid1988, together with an accord late
last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of commercial bank
debt, had already encouraged donors to increase aid, he added.
    Debt sources said a World Bank concessional loan of around
200 mln dlrs to help rationalise Moroccos public sector was
likely to be agreed in Washington soon.

developer Donald Trump said he has agreed to purchase the Class
B common stock of Resorts International Inc held by the family

    Trump said he is also considering a tender offer for

itself owns 340,783 of the 752,297 Class B shares. There are
also about 6,432,000 Class A shares outstanding, but Trump said
"I have no interest in the Class A shares."
    Each Class B share has 100 times the voting power of a

    In Atlantic City, Resorts said in a statement that the
Class B shares being sold to Trump represents 73 pct of the

<TITLE>HIGH COURT DECLINES TO HEAR APPEAL ON ATT CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court declined to hear an
appeal by U.S. West Inc ltUSW> challenging whether a consent
decree was legally binding on the seven regional telephone
firms created by the breakup of American Telephone and
Telegraph Co ltT>.
    The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by a U.S.
Court of Appeals last August that the restrictions of the 1982
decree were legally binding on the regional companies, even
though they were not parties to it.
    U.S. West, one of the seven regional companies, argued that
the restrictions violated the constitutional protections of due
process under the law because AT and T did not adequately
represent its subsidiaries during the consent decree
proceedings.
    The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject
the appeal, saying, "As a parent corporation, AT and T had the
legal authority to bind its operating subsidiaries in a
consent decree."
    Also opposing the appeal was AT and T.
    The appeals court ruling also allowed the Bell operating
companies to offer certain services outside their territory
without express permission of the federal courts.
    That part of the ruling was not appealed to the Supreme
Court.
    Justice Antonin Scalia did not take part in todays ruling,
and the court gave no explanation.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Barclays Bank Plc ltBCS.L> and Midland
Bank Plc ltMDBL.L> said they are cutting their base lending
rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The cuts follow a similar move
by National Westminster Bank Plc ltNWBL.L>
    The rate changes take effect tomorrow.
    The base rate reductions came after the Bank of England cut
its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets
that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank
base lending rates, market sources said.
    Until the end of last week, the central was holding out
staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an
apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around
the time of the governments annual Budget on March 17.
    Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its
close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.

<TITLE>U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it was taking
onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 83/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
83/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was
reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Banks
announcement, with the Treasury 131/2 pct stock due 2004/08
quoted one full point lower at 13412/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news.
    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
sterlings strength.
    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
pct.
    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawsons package of measures.
    However, in the face of sterlings apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
allow a halfpoint cut.
    Todays one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities attempts
last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
Government bond market.
    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
rapidly as last weeks.
    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
on a tradeweighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Fridays final
71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
GMT.

<TITLE>PAPER SAYS POINDEXTER MAY LINK REAGAN TO FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagans denial that he
knew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan
contra rebels might be challenged by his former national
security adviser, according to the Washington Post.
    The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resigned
last November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrs
was disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so far
maintained over the affair.
    The Post said he might tell a special Senate committee
investigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in
1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to the
contras.
    It said the panel was considering granting Poindexter
immunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which was
illegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time against
aid for the contras.
    Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution which protects people from giving evidence which
could be selfincriminating.
    Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran in
the hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but has
denied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebel
hands.
    A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story,
but David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling of
the affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action.
    Abshire, on the CBS television show "Face the Nation," did
not comment directly on the Post story, but said "He Reagan
is deeply honest, he is deeply dedicated, he tells the truth
and when he says he has no knowledge, he has no knowledge."
    The Post quoted a source close to Reagan as saying the
White House expected Poindexter "will say he had direction and
authority, directly or indirectly," from the president for the
diversion of funds.
    The paper said the former security advisers testimony
could damage the presidents claim he was unaware of the funds
diversion.
    It quoted a legal source as saying Poindexter and his
lawyers planned to contend that twice in 1986 he told Reagan
that the arms sales were generating money for the "contras."
    The paper quoted the source as saying Poindexter did not
tell Reagan there was an illegal diversion of funds, but that
help for the contras was "an ancillary benefit" of the sales.
    The Posts sources also said the Senate committee could
grant immunity from prosecution this month to Oliver North, who
was fired from the National Security Council on the same day
that Poindexter resigned.

<TITLE>PETROCANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. JOHNS, Newfoundland, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>PetroCanada, Canadas
stateowned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
Newfoundland.
    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
should put PetroCanada in a position to propose a development
plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
early as 1991, PetroCanada said.
    "We have a high degree of confidence that the western
portion of the Terra Nova field contains at least 11 mln
cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
production system," PetroCanada said.
    The TerraNova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
Johns and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
discovered by PetroCanada in 1984.
    "Weve had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
the field, and we hope this summers drilling will prove up
additional reserves there," the company said.
    PetroCanada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
towards development so it can start generating a return on
investments, PetroCanada said.
    PetroCanada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the fields East
Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
    PetroCanada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova fields
Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from PetroCanadas Calgary
office.
    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the fields East
Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
he added.
    PetroCanada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
development budget could double if the company builds a
production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
    PetroCanada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
production, with a production system that would have maximum
capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
answer to a query.
    The company estimates a production system combining both
Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

<TITLE>CHARAN SEES AT LEAST 50 PCT RISE IN 1987 PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Charan Industries Inc, a distributor
of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to
rise at least 50 pct over last years 6.1 mln dlrs, president
Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting.
    "We grew basically 100 pct last year, Im not sure were
going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we
certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman
said.
    Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln
dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended
November 30.
    Takefman said the company is actively looking for
acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in
Canada.
    The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems
this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy
distribution business, which accounts for about onethird of
revenues.
    Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for ltWorlds
of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voiceactivated
talking plush bear.
    Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the
shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy
Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll
with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and
talking books.
    The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser
tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when youve
hit someone.
    Other products include a recorder device which allows
students to leave taped messages in each others school
lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.

<TITLE>BARCLAYS, MIDLAND FOLLOW NATWEST BASE RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Barclays Bank Plc ltBCS.L> and Midland
Bank Plc ltMDBL.L> said they are cutting their base lending
rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The cuts follow a similar move
by National Westminster Bank Plc ltNWBL.L>
    The rate changes take effect tomorrow.
    The base rate reductions came after the Bank of England cut
its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets
that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank
base lending rates, market sources said.
    Until the end of last week, the central was holding out
staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an
apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around
the time of the governments annual Budget on March 17.
    Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its
close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.

<TITLE>LLOYDS BANK MATCHES BASE RATE CUT TO 10.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyds Bank Plc said it is cutting its
base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct, effective tomorrow.
    The reduction follows similar moves from the three other
British clearing banks.
    National Westminster Bank Plc led the way this morning
after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in a signal
that it would tolerate a half percentage point reduction.
    The central banks surprise signal followed its strenuous
efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down
base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17.

<TITLE>UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A half point cut in base lending rates
was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the
Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of
downward pressure, dealers said.
    During its routine intervention in the market, the bank
trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by
half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing
banks in reducing its base rate to 101/2 pct from 11 pct.
    The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by
surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen
hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.
       For some time, fundamentals have
led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending
rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow
wholesale money market rates down.
    Although political considerations  the governments wish
to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget  had
been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Banks
delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling
and perhaps about the markets reaction to the content of the
Budget may have been behind the central banks caution, dealers
said.
    In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,
leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.
    Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the
day, onemonth interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to
109/16 7/16 and threemonths trading 1/16 point down at
105/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cds were similarly down between
5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.
    Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at
around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the
end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some
113/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated
300 mln stg shortage.

was issuing the first certificates of deposit from a Danish
bank and that the CDs will be for six, nine and 12 months or a

    They will come in denominations of 10 mln crowns without

capital market rates and paid on a discount basis, with
certificates sold below par and maturing at par, a bank

    The certificates are not liable to stamp duty. "They will be
a flexible supplement to negotiated deposits and will give
companies and institutional investors better chances to
organise liquidity," the statement said.
    Bank spokesman Arne Lund said "We could not do it earlier
because it was not possible for the tax authorities to say if
the certificates were liable to stamp duty or not."
    He said the issue should be assisted by high shortterm

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/AMERICAN EXPRESS ltAXP></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Cos stock fell
sharply, reflecting, in part, investors disappointment that
the company did not make an announcement about its plans for
brokerage unit Shearson Lehman Brothers, traders said.
    The company has said it is studying options for its
Shearson unit. Traders said many investors anticipated an
announcement this weekend that it would spin off Shearson
Lehman. Also, they said, a flurry of arbitrage related sell
programs that pounded the general market today accelerated the
selloff of American Express, a component of the Dow Industrial
Average. American Express fell 31/8 to 773/8.
    "It was part programs and part that there was anticipation
of an announcement of a spinoff or something with Shearson this
weekend, and that announcement never happened," one trader
said.
    In the last few minutes of trading on Friday, another
trader said, the stock jumped to close up 33/8, largely on
anticipation that the company would make a weekend
announcement.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE  S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>In an unusual move, Standard and Poors
Corp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it was
priced for offering late last week.
    But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, which
investment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agencys
rate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.
    S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B from
Bplus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of Holiday
Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp ltHIA>. The notes were priced
late Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    In a release, Standard and Poors said the action reflected
a change in the note issues terms to an unsecured form of debt
from secured. That change was made after the agency rated the
notes on February 20, S and P stated.
    "We took action as we became aware that the issues
structure had changed," said Robert Nelson of S and P. "We
generally make a distinction between secured and unsecured
debt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."
    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the
Holiday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by
late Friday afternoon.
    "The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a whenissued
basis," the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and Ps
announcement. The 101/2 pct notes had been priced at par.
    That is a far cry from late September, when S and P
downgraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund
debentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd ltNWP> just hours
after the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCCplus from
Bminus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.
    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially
gave the debentures a 121/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It
then repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.
    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs
from an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in
S and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action
and said it believed the issuers cash from existing operations
would not be enough to adequately service debt.
    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency
was not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in
size. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating
agencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.
    In both cases, Moodys Investors Service Inc declined to
follow suit, bond traders noted.
    Indeed, Moodys announced Friday that its original rating
of B1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.
    Moodys pointed out that while the sevenyear notes would
be unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would
benefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for
specified collateral under certain circumstances.
    The agency also said the B1 rating continued to recognize
a highly leveraged debt structure that would result from
Holidays recapitalization program, as well as the companys
dependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for
nearterm debt service.
    "Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot
remember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after
the pricing," remarked one corporate bond trader.
    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of
subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par
pricing. The debentures ratings of B2 by Moodys and Bminus
by S and P were left unchanged on Friday.
    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the
secondlargest junk bond deal ever brought to market,
underwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI
Holdings 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.
    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the
appetite of many investors for highyield securities.
    "People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about
downside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by
wellknown companies," said one portfolio manager.
    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this weeks
planned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of
senior notes due 1992, rated B2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior
subordinated debentures due 1997, rated B3/CCCplus.
    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it has
tentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today.

<TITLE>TRADERS SAY USDA MAY LOWER ORANGE CROP ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Agriculture will
probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange
crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,
analysts and industry sources said.
    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at
1500 hrs EST 2100 gmt today.
    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward
revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.
    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since
October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a
shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those
harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA
projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln
boxes larger than they were.
    "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, an
FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The only
question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this
estimate."
    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate
by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to
drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture
clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of
Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.
    "Theyll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with
Shearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come in
July."
    She expects todays estimate will be 126 mln boxes.

<TITLE>RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the conference on a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA, Manaspas Xuto of
Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main
outstanding issues this week.
    The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today
under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development UNCTAD, is scheduled to last until March 20.
    Xuto told delegates this session of the conference
presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it
had to be the last before the current accord expires in
October.
    Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of
major exporting and importing countries over the last few
months, "I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to
be flexible on the part of all concerned."
    "It is imperative that we try to settle the major
outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a
considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to
be completed." He said he will immediately start consultations
with producers and consumers.
    The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement
over buffer stock operations.
    Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed
at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the
International Tin Agreement ITA, were rejected by producers
who argued for unchanged INRA terms.
    The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out
of funds to support prices.
    Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and
consumers for a new fiveyear pact ended without agreement. The
INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to
October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation.
    Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he
was cautiously optimistic "that together we should be able to
save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."
    Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would
become more volatile.
    Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and
reality, he said, "There is no reason why we could not put aside
differences and come up with a successor agreement."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Moodys Investors Service Inc said the
212.75 mln dlrs of debt of USAir Group Inc and its USAir Inc
unit remain under review for possible downgrade.
    The rating agency cited USAir Groups proposed acquisition
of Piedmont Aviation Inc ltPIE>, as well as Trans World Airlines
Incs ltTWA> proposed cash merger with USAir.
    However, the status of TWAs bid for USAir Group is
currently uncertain. The U.S. Transportation Department has
rejected TWAs application to acquire USAir on deficiency
grounds, but TWA has said it will file a revised application,
Moodys noted.
    Under Moodys review for possible downgrade are USAir
Groups Baa1 senior debt and Baa2 subordinated debentures,
along with the USAir units A3 senior debt and Baa1
subordinated debentures.
    Moodys said it would examine the effects of the proposed
mergers on USAir Groups financial measurements, as well as
potential damage to the companys financial flexibility because
of the probability of increased debtservice requirements.

<TITLE>BALLY ltBLY> TO TAKE 17.3 MLN DLR 1ST QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Bally Manufacturing Corp said it
expects a charge to earnings in the first quarter of this year
of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of
its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Chicagobased hotel, casino, gambling and amusement concern
also said the anticipated charge against first quarter earnings
will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy 2.6 mln of
the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4
mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of
Bally.
    The agreement also calls for Bally to pay Trump another 6.2
mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to
his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said.
    Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to
seek control of the company for 10 years, it said.
    Bear, Stearns and Co Inc signed a similar standstill
agreement with Bally for three years, Bally said. But it can
still deal in Bally stock as a broker, it said.
    The deal also obligates Bally to buy Trumps remaining
stake in the company for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price
does not reach that level by February 21, 1988, it said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Rolls Royce, the U.K.s stateowned car
and aircraft engine maker, is seeking a 250 mln stg multiple
option facility to provide it with additional sources of
financing, banking sources said.
    They said the facility, which will be syndicated among a
small group of the borrowers relationship banks, is being put
in place ahead of the privatisation of Rolls Royce in April or
May. At the borrowers request, terms will not be disclosed
until later this week, when bankers expect the syndication to
close. But while the terms are in line with the market, they
are somewhat tight, bankers said.
    The bankers noted that although Rolls Royces debt will be
negligible after privatisation it wants to have a range of
financing arrangements available to allow it to take advantage
of market opportunities when they become available.
    The financing will involve a 150 mln stg fiveyear
committed tranche and will be backed by an uncommitted tender
panel through which Rolls Royce will be able to issue bills or
multicurrency advances.
    S.G. Warburg and Co Ltd is arranger for the financing, the
bankers said.

<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury Department is due to
release funds for the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, to pay
for the coffee purchased from local producers, the IBC said in

prices.
    The statement said the IBC is sending a document to the
National Monetary Council asking the government to set a budget
for the purchase by the Institute of up to five mln bags of
coffee until June 30.
    Gomes said in the statement there have been no problems in
the concession of funds by the Treasury for payment of the
coffee delivered to the IBC warehouses by the producers.
    He said producers have already delivered 2.2 mln bags, of
which 1.5 mln bags have been paid for.

the Treasury, the Institute will no longer need to seek
approval by the Treasury to seek the release of additional

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SAY COMPANY HOLDINGS FALLING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>West German private banks, in the
latest twist in a longrunning battle over the size of their
holdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling and
rejected calls for tighter limits on these participations.
    Under West Germanys banking system, banks can hold shares
in nonbanking companies giving them seats on company
supervisory boards, and administer the holdings of small
shareholders in safe custody accounts.
    Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in the
supervisory board of a company, must be disclosed.
    "The claim that the concentration of power has intensified,
as made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out not
to be accurate ... There is no reason to impose further legal
restrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks," it said.
    The Associations letter is the latest skirmish in a long
running battle between banks on the one hand and a range of
government offices and political lobbies on the left and right.
    The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companies
with a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held by
these 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said.
    Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25
pct in 1976. The banks holdings of nominal share capital fell
to 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted for
capital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976.
    Over this period total West German nominal share capital
rose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holding
of banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct.
    The nominal share capital of listed nonbank companies rose
to an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in
1976, with banks holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2
pct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said.
    It argued that bank representatives were in a minority on
the supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, and
in most cases could be blocked by nonbanking representatives.
    The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG ltDBKG.F>, Dresdner Bank
AG ltDRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG ltCBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG
ltBVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken und WechselBank AG
ltBHWG.F>.
    It also covered Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank
ltBHFG.F>, ltBerliner Bank AG>, ltIndustriekreditbank AG>,
Vereins und Westbank AG ltVHBG.F> and ltBadenWuerttembergische
Bank AG>.
    Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes,
including 28.5 pct of DaimlerBenz AG ltDAIG.F>.
    Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from the
Monopolies Commission and leftwing parties. An advisory
commission, in a report late last year to the Economics
Ministry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by the
Monopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interest
conflicts.
    The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberal
Free Democrat Party, junior partner in the centreright
coalition government and increasingly in favour of
deregulation.
    Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recently
supported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demanding
more transparency in the banks balance sheet.
    The shareholder argued that the banks ability to declare
industrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporary
holdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them in
full. If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have to
disclose them but can include them under securities holdings.
    The case is due to be heard again by the Frankfurt higher
regional court.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank intends to bring
borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight
of opinion is that in a year from now there is a higher
probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
interest rates," he said.
    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years
anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
instruments such as bonds with warrants.
    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

<TITLE>EC FARMERS INCOMES ROSE SLIGHTLY IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Disposable income available to people
employed in European Community agriculture rose 0.9 pct in 1986
after an 8.8 pct fall the previous year, the EC statistics
agency Eurostat said in a report.
    It said income available to farm holders and members of
their family working on the holding rose 2.5 pct after a 13.9
pct fall in 1985.
    Eurostat said the reason for the increases was higher
production, with a 1.6 pct increase in crop output and a 0.7
pct rise in animal products compared with 1985.
    However, Eurostat added a 1.6 pct fall in prices for animal
products was more than offset by a 3.1 pct increase in those
for crops.
    It said income changes varied widely across the EC in 1986.
Disposable income of all those employed in agriculture rose
12.9 pct in West Germany but fell 7.8 pct in Denmark, while
income available to holders and their families rose 17.0 pct in
Britain but fell 9.7 pct in Ireland.

    He was joined by Justices William Brennan, Byron White,

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/CHRYSLER ltC>, AMC ltAMO></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under
which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was
described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common
stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"
given changes brought by tax reform and that Chryslers offer
to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other
than Renault as a "a good price for Chrysler.
    AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after
the RenaultChrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler
shares lost 1/4 to 521/4.
    Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying
the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he
regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I cant believe
anybody else would make a bid."
    "Its a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told
Reuters.
    "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the new AMC
Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the new Renault Premier
midsized car and AMCs sales will go up because buyers will
have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around
to service the products," Glantz said.
    Analyst Thomas OGrady said Chrysler would be getting more
manufacturing capacity, including a brandnew plant in Canada,
for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return
after its prolonged lossmaking investment in AMC.

oilseeds, such as soybeans, less desirable because they would

<DATELINE>    MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Holiday Corp said its Holiday Inn
Hotel Group will soon introduce a chain of limitedservice
hotels in international markets.
    The company said the chain, which will be launched
initially in Western Europe, will usually feature 60 to 150
guest rooms and a small restuarant/lounge area, but will offer
fewer services and amenities than typical Holiday Inn hotels.
    It said the new hotels will cater to commercial travelers
in smaller cities and suburbs.

<TITLE>FERRY DISASTER CLAIMS COULD TOP 30 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln
stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster,
a spokesman for Lloyds of London said.
    It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation
claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before
it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,
said David Larner of Lloyds.
    The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise
were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend
Thoresens parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Co Plc ltPORL.L>.
    The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with
Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said.
    Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard
Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several
shipowners mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also
underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.
    Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to
total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the
normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974
of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.
    Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could
soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults
involved.
    Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure
guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged,
the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.
    Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell
across the board in a generally weak market.
    General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped
18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888.
    P and O shares stood at a late 616, 27p lower on the day.

<TITLE>GERMAN EMPLOYERS MAKE SURPRISE OFFER TO ENGINEERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KREFELD, West Germany, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Engineering industry
employers in North RhineWestphalia state said they made an
unprecedented offer on pay and working hours.
    The offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000
workers, was the first time since World War Two that employers
have proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting a
repeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the auto
industry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said.
    The employers propose a halfhour cut in the 38.5 hour
working week from July 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct from
April 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
    The engineering union IG Metall, Europes largest union,
wants a five pct wage rise and a 35hour week at full pay.
    It called todays warning strikes, mostly involving work
stoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talks
since December failed.
    The employers offer was seen breaking the deadlock in
negotiations, even though the union said the halfhour cut is
not enough, union sources said.
    The offer applies to workers in North RhineWestphalia and
it was unclear if further offers would be presented in talks
between unions and employers of other West German states.

<TITLE>BANK OF ZAMBIA PAYS OUT FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign
exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a
bank spokesman said.
    "We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only
four, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said without
specifying the amount paid out.
    The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms
since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.
    It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned
to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
    President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the
auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to
approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to
determine the kwachas exchange rate.
    Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because
of a shortage of foreign exchange.
    The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha
per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct.

<TITLE>PIEZO ltPEPI> PREFERRED HOLDERS SEEK BOARD SEATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A group of brokerage executives with
a 25.25 pct stake in the cumulative convertible preferred stock
of Piezo Electric Products Inc said it will seek two seats on
the companys board of directors.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Providence Securities Inc, a Providence, R.I. brokerage firm,
and two executives said they will seek the seats that opened
because of a dividend payment default to preferred holders.
    The firm, its president, Thomas DePetrillo, and its vice
president, Vincent DiGuilio, also said they may seek additional
representation on the companys board.
    The Cambridge, Mass., research firm defaulted on dividends
to preferred holders on January 31, which automatically gives
preferred holders the right to elect two directors, the
executives said.
    The firm and its two executives, who hold a combined
104,500 preferred shares, said they originally bought their
stake as an investment, but are also trying to motivate the
company into reinstating dividends.
    DePetrillo said he has proposed that the preferred
conversion rate change to 85toone from 10toone and that
dividends be cut to 10 cts a share from 1.10 dlrs.

<TITLE>VNESHTORGBANK SEEKS INCREASE FOR FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Vneshtorgbank, the Soviet Foreign Trade
bank, is seeking an increase to 250 mln stg from the original
150 mln for a five year, sterling bankers acceptance facility
arranged last autumn, Lloyds Merchant Bank Ltd said as
arranger.
    The facility has a 10 basis point facility fee and there is
a 15 basis point maximum cap on the margin.
    Banking sources said syndication for the increase was
proceeding very well so far, although the syndication would not
necessarily be confined to banks participating in the original
group.
    Banking sources said that one reason for the increase was
that Vneshtorgbank had been very impressed by the relatively
low cost of financing by means of eligible bills, rather than
through more traditional instruments priced in relation to
London Interbank Offered Rates LIBOR.
    The facility is Vneshtorgbanks first ever
sterlingdenominated bankers acceptance facility.
    Banking sources noted that Vneshtorgbank now has two
facilities in the market, since First Chicago Ltd was awarded a
mandate last week to arrange a 200 mln dlr, eight year loan at
1/8 point over LIBOR.

<TITLE>DART SAID LIKELY SUPERMARKETS GENERAL SUITOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Dart Group ltDARTA> is likely seeking to
buy Supermarkets General ltSGL>, analysts said.
    "Theres been rumors that theyve taken a position in the
company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.
    Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown
Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway
Stores INc.
    The company later reached an accord under which it would
buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its
leveraged buyout of the company.
    The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln
to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.
     Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.
    Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward
Viner and Co, said, "They ltDart> has been rumored to be buying
some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."
    "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be
bought out," said Ballan.
    Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing
problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations,
which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.
    Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs
a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a
post stock split basis.
    For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will
earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should
earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.
    "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to
Purity Supreme in New England," Comeau said.
    He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in
that area and that the company has had difficulty with
integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.
    Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to
the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as
an operating unit, according to analysts.
    Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it
would probably divest the companys operations.
    Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a
combination with another supermarket company."

<TITLE>FED WATCHERS SEE U.S. ECONOMIC, INFLATION UPTURN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>This year will see a pickup in U.S.
economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee
said in its semiannual policy statement.
    The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" private
economists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987
in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal
Reserve."
    The group said the Feds actions have been excessive. As a
result, it said that "inflation and ultimately another
recession now loom on the horizon."
    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on
progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead
to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.
    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or
inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the
Committee at its Sunday policymaking meeting said it was
basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a
member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.
    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage
point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer
prices to rise about 41/2 pct this year.
    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been
a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly
inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandon
its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary
base on the path toward sustained lower inflation."
    The Fed in February said it would no longer target the
narrow M1 money supply because the link between M1 and
economic growth has been largely severed.

on the London Exchange during hours when the NYSE was open.
London plans to close its trading floor in due course, but the
NYSE only recognises foreign exchanges which possess a trading
floor.

<TITLE>DUTCH CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS FALLS IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Dutch current account surplus fell
5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion
guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
    The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the
statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the
official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to
fall to six billion guilders during 1987.
    The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6
billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms
of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer
spending and investment increased.
    While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion
guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary
improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay
between the fall in oil and gas prices.
    The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on
invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance
Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was
reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price
falls.
    The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for
the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/CAESARS WORLD ltCAW></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg Calhoun, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>ltMTS Acquisition Corps>
28dlrpershare offering price for Caesars World Inc is
thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other
suitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.
    "I think someone else will probably come in, or they MTS
will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars Worlds
largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at
725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesnt already own.
    "I think the offer is too low by at least five points,"
said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of
"one of the finest casinos in the world."
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of
Caesars Worlds 30.3 mln shares.
    Following news of the tender offer Caesars Worlds shares
were trading at 277/8, up 33/8.
    A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining
comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may
issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.
    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
dlrs per share.
    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
resorts in Pennsylvanias Pocono Mountains. It also controls
Caesars New Jersey Inc ltCJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,
N.J., casino hotel.
    For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported
net income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.
    The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln
dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln
dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
    Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
that although Sosnoffs relatively low bid may attract other
suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
the company.

<TEXT>2
<TITLE>USX ltX> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>USX Corp chairman David Roderick called
for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies
to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which
last year reached 170 billion dlrs.
    In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club
of Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve that
the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the
currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus
with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our
trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."
    Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the
"economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result of
a falling dollar.
    But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to our
trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem
uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,
lengthy and steep world recession."
    Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the
dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major
industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader
group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.
    At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in
the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240
billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a
surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the
data were provided by economic consultants to USX.
    The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct
rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other
factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,
"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental
deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product
quality."
    These areas need to be improved but they are not the root
cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged
American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can
compete in global markets.
    In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in
securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate
raiders and speculators.
    Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate
Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement
that raiders give 24hour notice for every one pct of stock
they acquire in a company.
    Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all
cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be
required to have financing in place before a tender is made.
    Further, raiders should be required to make an allcash
tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target companys
stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential
price by a target company to buy back a raiders stake, should
be prohibited under the revised laws.
    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but
that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets
or discourage "fair price to all" takeovers.

<TITLE>CANADIAN PACIFIC CP CONFIRMS EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth
quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts
a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.
    The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings
figures the company released in February.
    A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CPs Cominco Ltd
interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8
mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.
    The company said a drop in 1986 fullyear operating profit
to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was
due mainly to lower world oil prices.
    The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net
income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985.
It said grain traffic recovered from droughtaffected levels of
a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas
and increased expenses.
    It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5
mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to
restructuring charges.
    Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the
year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a
recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest
products sector.

<TITLE>LMFE TO CONCENTRATE ON CASH SETTLED CONTRACTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,
will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from
April 3, the LMFE said.
    The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the
cash settled contracts introduced last year.
    "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our
marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE official
Peter Freeman said. "These two have already shown their
effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is
increasing," he added.
    "Using the futures market allows better planning and forward
price fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said.
    Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and
Livestock Commissions Average All Pigs Price in February,
which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice
the number cashsettled in January, the LMFE said.
    Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was
introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the
futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would
increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

<TITLE>PRIMARY EUROSTERLING MARKET BOOMS DESPITE RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dominique Jackson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Two new eurosterling bonds were launched
today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this
month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market
fueled by the strength of the pound and prebudget euphoria.
    The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in
banks base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this
had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from
the current popularity of sterlingdenominated investments.
    "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and
were set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said.
    Todays new eurosterling bonds were a 10year, 100 mln stg
deal for Sweden at 91/2 pct and priced at 1011/4 pct, lead by
Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible
deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "We
thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we
had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down
with 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said.
    "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much
more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a
cheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added.
    This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have
tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the
Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.
    Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current
vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last
month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.
    A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at
Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.
    This is the first entry into the long term international
capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence
Conrans retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain
stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.
    "We have been considering the move for quite some time now
and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided
the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the
market," Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told
Reuters.

<TITLE>MCDONNELL ltMD> SAID TALKS AT INFORMAL STAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talks
with Airbus Industries about joint development and production
of a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturing
consortium have been very informal.
    "If there have been talks, they were casual at best," said
a source at the company. "There is nothing going on that would
lead to immediate or nearterm collaboration" on a new plane.
    Senior officials at the aerospace firms St. Louis
headquarters were unable to comment more specifically on
weekend published reports from Europe that talks about a joint
venture have resumed after they broke off last fall.
    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer had
discussed jointly developing and building a longrange aircraft
to compete with Boeing Co ltBA> 747 widebody jetliner, or its
successor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans
to launch its own widebody jetliner projects  McDonnell
Douglas with its MD11 and Airbus with its A340.
    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD11 jetliner, a
successor to its DC10, and has more than 100 orders and
options.
    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now
seeking customers for the longrange A340 and a companion
plane, the shorterrange A330.
    "I dont want to say were not interested, because we are
in any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without it
giving up anything," the source told Reuters. "There just
havent been indepth discussions."
    He said any joint venture would not affect the MD11
program already underway.
    McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried to
overturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD11 by offering
cutrate prices for the A340.
    The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enough
customers to launch the program, is engaging in "predatory
practices" with prices substantially below those needed to
recover the cost of developing and building the plane.
    U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believe
Airbus can offer low prices because the consortium gets
government subsidies that cover many of its costs.
    The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult the
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determine
whether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules an
enterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit.
    U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billion
dlrs into Airbus since the early 1970s and the consortium has
yet to make a profit.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The volume of European exports to
South Africa carried by container line vessels has declined 40
pct in the last two years, British shipping executive Antony
Butterwick said.
    Butterwick told reporters that despite the drop and low
freight rates, the shipping conference he heads will increase
the frequency of sailings to South Africa as a "very strong act
of faith and confidence" in the countrys future.
    He is chairman of the Europe South and SouthEast African
Conference Lines and joint managing director of P and O
Containers Ltd.
    A statement issued by the conference here said frequency of
Southern Africa/Europe container service sailings is being
increased from nine to seven days.
    "This is the most positive development on the shipping front
between South Africa and its main trading partners in Europe
for more than four years, when the service last operated
weekly," it said.

    Talks broke off last autumn after the two rivals failed to

<TITLE>MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS SETS OPERATIONS SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ELMSFORD, N.Y., March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Mathematical Applications Group
Inc said it has signed a letter of intent to sell all of its
operating business and will propose a plan of liquidation
following the sale.
    If the company is unsuccessful in obtaining the approvals
needed for the sale and liquidation, it said, the company may
be required to initiate reorganization proceedings under
federal bankruptcy law to facilitie the distribution of its
assets.
    Mathematical Applications said it tentatively agreed to
sell its direct marketing business to Pagex Inc for 400,000
dlrs plus an amount equal to the working capital of the
business at closing as well as a 1.7 mln dlr note payable in
installments over six years.
    Mathematical Applications said the business working
capital is estimated to be about 600,000 dlrs.
    Pagex has been formed by Paul A. Goldner the owner of Pagex
Systems Inc, which is also engaged in the direct marketing
computer service business.
    Mathematical Applications said the tentative agreement
calls for Pagex to buy substantially all of the assets and
liabilities related to the direct marketing business and
continue to use the Mathematical Applications name.
    It said the sale is also subject to renegotiation of a real
estate lease and approval of a definitive agreement by the
companys board, stock holders and debenture holders.
    The company said it has obtained waivers from holders of
its six mln dlrs principal amount of debentures due March 31,
1993, to defer interest payments aggregating 270,000 dlrs
through March 31, 1987. The company said it will seek waivers
to defer these interest payments, and those due March 31, for
enough time to enable the company to accomplish the proposed
sale of its operations.
    Mathematical Applications said it is talking to debenture
holders, its landlord, a lessor of equipment to the marketing
operation and holders of other liabilities not being assumed by
Pagex to arrange distribution of assets after the proposed
sale, adding that these assets will be significantly less than
its liabilities.

<TITLE>SEN. ZORINSKYS DEATH RAISES POLICY QUESTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>With the death of Sen. Edward
Zorinsky DNeb., Midwestern grain farmers have lost an ally
who from his senior post on the Senate Agriculture Committee
had fought hard against cutbacks in farm benefits.
    Zorinskys passing could trim the Democrats majority in
the Senate and change the makeup of the Senate farm panel.
    Zorinsky, who died of a heart attack last Friday, was the
secondranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee and
chairman of the crucial subcommittee on agricultural production
and stabilization of prices.
    Once a Republican, Zorinsky was fiscal conservative. But he
was an outspoken critic of Reagan administration proposals to
trim target prices, and at the time of his death was girding
himself for another push for mandatory supply controls.
    If Melcher decides, however, to continue as chairman of the
subcommittee on agricultural research, conservation, forestry
and general legislation, other Democrats would have a crack at
the vacated chairmanship.
    By order of seniority, those senators would be David Pryor
Ark., David Boren Okla., Howell Heflin Ala. and Tom
Harkin DIowa, a forceful advocate of mandatory supply
controls.

were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord
two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels.
    Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International
Settlements BIS, which reviewed the agreement, they also
welcomed interest rates cuts in France and todays drop in
British rates.  One top official said the rate cuts would help
to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that
countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping
sustain the economy. 
    The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be
named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10
countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the
IMFs latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they
discussed Brazils debt moratorium.
    But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil
had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central
banks.

<TITLE>USAIR ltU> SEEKS TWO BILLION LOAN FOR TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said it seeking two
billion dlrs in bank debt to complete its takeover of Piedmont
Aviation Inc ltPIE> and its pending acquisition of PS Group
Incs Pacific Southwest Airlines.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that details its proposed 69 dlr a share cash tender offer for
Piedmont, USAir said Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co ltMHC>
"indicates its willingness" in a March 6 letter to provide up
to 500 mln dlrs of the financing.
    Manufacturers Hanover would also to act as agent for a bank
group to raise the rest of the financing, USAir said.
    USAir said a Manufacturers Hanover affiliate is currently
agent for its 400 mln dlrs revelving credit facility, which
would be replaced by the proposed two billion dlr financing.
    USAir put its total cost of completing the tender offer at
1.7 billion dlrs. Its Pacific Southwest takeover, which has
received federal approval and is due to come up for shareholder
approval later this month, is for 17 dlrs a share, or 400 mln
dlrs total.
    USAir said it has already bought 2.3 mln Piedmont common
shares, or 9.9 pct of the total outstanding from Norfolk
Southern Corp ltNSC> for 161.9 mln dlrs.
    The tender offer, which is being made through a USAir
subsidiary, USAG Acquisition Corp, would not be valid unless
USAir is left with more than half of Piedmonts total
outstanding common stock after the April 3 expiration.
    While negotiations on terms and interest rates of its bank
loans are not yet complete, USAir said it expects them to be in
the form of a one billion dlr twoyear term loan and a one
billion dlr sevenyear revolving credit facility.
    The company said it expects to repay the twoyear loan
through equity, preferred and debt offerings and possibly
internal funds and the sale and/or leaseback of aircraft.

<TITLE>FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Department will have
to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of inkind
certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA
decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.
    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for
the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50
cashcertificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they
want to do the same for feedgrains.
    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn
deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42
billion dlrs 43 pct set in certificates. The final payment
must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs 57 pct for a 50/50 split.
    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,
doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.
    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
release of certs onto the market.
    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after
harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.
    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan RIll. nor Sen. Bob Dole
RKans., sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation
forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian marines were today
working on the unloading of ships at the local port as a
national strike by 40,000 seamen entered its 10th day without
signs of an agreement.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise.
    Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamen
rejected.
    "Television reported that the port was operating at full
speed, but thats not true," a striking seaman told Reuters.
    "The marines are doing their best, but they dont have the
manpower nor the experience to control the situation in such a
quick period," he said.
    Port officials said the national halt had already caused
losses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports of
incidents.

<TITLE>USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26
mln tonnes from last months projection of 23 mln tonnes.
    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said
the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the
U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and
coarse grain from other major suppliers.
    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one
mln from last months estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the
preliminary 1985/86 figure.
    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln
tonnes. Record or nearrecord livestock inventories, along with
a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a
cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.
    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly
from the previous Januarys level, while milk production
increased by nearly six pct.
    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in
roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock
production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,
USDA said.

<TITLE>ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Quito, march 9  </DATELINE><BODY>up to 300 people were feared dead and more
than 15,000 people left homeless by thursdays earthquake,
which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum
revenues, authorities said.
    They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline
at 150 mln dlrs.
    "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is
gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting
the damages in napo, the hardesthit jungle province, 100 miles
from here.
    The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this
opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president
febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the
presidential press office.
    The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude
exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It
would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries
oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific
ocean port.
    Crude traditionally accounts for up to twothirds of
ecuadors exports.
    the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river
which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo
province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.
    "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is
no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have
disappeared," he said.
    Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.
    So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.
    Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters "the number
of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how
many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."
    Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the
cayambe district.

<TITLE>FRANCE TO REQUEST PERMANENT MAIZE REBATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>French maize producers will ask the EC
Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following
the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual
export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four
years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.
    The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for
the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates
for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.
    The request will be made when export certificates have been
granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.
    The association said that the request would cover exports
to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has
important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of
destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize
imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against
10.40 mln in 1985/86.

<TITLE>U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EXFED CHIEF SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar will decline over the next
two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a
complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said
Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg USA Inc and former
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said
without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in
the dollar," within the next three years.
    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit
will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"
he said.
    Solomon described the structural core as about onehalf of
the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several
factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.
    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new
investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when
the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased
propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.
    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by yearend, but said
it could be kept below five pct in the mediumterm if oil
prices are stable and commodity values remain low.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Lima, march 9  </DATELINE><BODY>a confidential world bank report on the
peruvian economy said the governments strategy does not offer
good prospects for medium and longterm growth and is likely to
quickly lead to inflation.
    The report, published today by an economic monthly, the
peru report, said the success of president alan garcias
government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct
gross domestic product growth "represents gains in the short
term at the expense of the long."
    Government officials had no immediate comment on the
report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the
public investment programme and greater emphasis on the
preservation of perus export potential.
    The report said that although the government had succeeded
in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to
under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was
encountering increasing difficulties.
    "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to
monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of
price controls, appears not improbable," it added.

<TITLE>MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>European Community finance ministers
discussed the economic outlook for the 12nation bloc and many
said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too
pessimistic.
    The Commission, the ECs executive authority, two weeks ago
cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3
per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.
    It said economic prospects had been less promising over the
past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the
dollar and a slowing of world trade  factors which would
restrain Community exports.
    But diplomats said several member states, led by West
Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,
especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement
between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    "Many delegations feel the Commissions report is rather
too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,
who chaired the meeting.
    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West
Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it
feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to
stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.
    But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto
Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at
the moment for action to bolster the ECs biggest economy.
    The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,
while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commissions view
that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.

<TITLE>BROKERS SAY NYSE RULE SHIFT LIMITS FLEXIBILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Officials of major brokerage firms
expressed dismay at a New York Stock Exchange decision to force
strict compliance with a rule barring members from trading in
NYSElisted issues in London during New York trading hours.
    Most major brokerage houses said they had seen no formal
notice from the NYSE on the interpretation of rule 390.
Officials of the NYSE were unavailable to explain the timing or
the technical details of enforcement of rule 390.
    "Its a step backward," said Samuel Hunter, senior vice
president for equity trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
    Hunter said any perceived problems caused by overlapping
trading ought to be addressed by a search for equitable
solutions instead of "hiding behind legalistic and technical
definitions."
    The NYSE evidently feels some traders use London to
circumvent rules preventing short sales on minus ticks, Hunter
said. But he believes simultaneous printing of trades in London
and New York would be a way to have dual trading with an
element of fairness. "Im a great advocate of the view that the
greater the volume, the better the market will be," he said.

<TITLE>API PRESIDENT SEES OPTIONS TO AVERT OIL CRISIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>American Petroleum Institute President
Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat 
growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    "No action should be ruled outimport fees or quotas,
floor prices, tax incentives or other alternativeswhile a
national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a 
paper institute conference in New York today.
    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on
how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on
removing several government policies that hinder investments in
new prospects.
    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished
immediately and current proposals for increased environmental
regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not
adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil
companies, DiBona said.
    "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the
nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona
said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while
consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported
oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

<TITLE>TOP U.S. OFFICIAL SEES DELAY IN BANK REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A top Treasury official said he does
not expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.
banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election due
to political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insider
trading scandal on Wall Street.
    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a Wall
Street Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going to
happen before the election ... people do not like to vote on
controversial issues in election years."
    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to get
something done," he added.
    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,
which would probably feature wider investment banking powers
for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private
interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.
    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... these
groups are trying to cloak selfinterest in public policy
terms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it is
to get it going."
    He also described current concern about insider trading as
"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpful
backdrop to accomplish financial reform."
    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that the
Reagan Administrations proposal for the recapitalization of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watered
down.
    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,
compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs over
three years.
    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on banking
reform but said that some broad guidelines to address these
issues would be made public over the next few months.

<TITLE>S/P MAY DOWNGRADE CHRYSLER ltC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poors said it placed 6.6
billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp securities on CreditWatch with
negative implications because of its plan to acquire the
outstanding common shares of American Motors Corp ltAMO> from
Renault Acceptance BV for about two billion dlrs.
    Among the ratings under review is Chryslers BBB grading
for senior debt. The AMC purchase is larger and riskier than
current ratings anticipate, but any downgrade would be small
and Chrysler would remain investment grade, S and P said.
    American Motorss CCC preferred stock rating was also added
to CreditWatch, but with positive implications.
    Standard and Poors said that, in return for its two
billion dlr investment, Chrysler would be receiving a business
with questionable prospects.
    "The Jeep line is a worthwhile extension for Chryslers
product line, but the presumed price seems hard to justify. The
additional production facilities inlcude both modern and
antiquated plant, all of which will add to Chryslers fixed
overhead and increase its breakeven point at a time that the
industry faces a glut of automaking capacity.
    "Chrysler will be challenged to integrate these facilities
and the distribution network it is acquiring," S and P said.

<TITLE>CANADA MULLING SELLING PETROCANADA  MULRONEY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the
government was considering selling PetroCanada and the sale
would proceed if it were in the national interest to do so.
    Mulroney told the House of Commons assets of the huge oil
company would be examined before a decision was made, just as
other staterun companies were studied before being sold under
Ottawas privatization program.
    "The government is going to examine assets of this nature
to ascertain if they continue to play an appropriate role in
public policy and we will make a determination as we have in
other cases," Mulroney told the daily question period.         
    Asked by opposition members to clairify Finance Minister
Michael Wilsons statement on Friday that PetroCanada no
longer has any pubilic policy role, Mulroney said his
government has long promised to sell off companies that could
be better run by the private sector.
    Outside the House, Energy Minister Marcel Masse said
PetroCanada would be worth between three and four billion dlrs
and, because of the size, could be difficult to sell.
    He also said he would prefer to see Canadians participating
in any privatization, but would not give any details on timing
of a sale.

<TITLE>U.S. COURT LETS CHINESE BOND SUIT DISMISSAL STAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court left intact a
ruling that vacated a judgment ordering China to pay 41.3 mln
dlrs for allegedly defaulting on a 1911 loan to finance
construction of a railroad from Peking to Canton.
    The Imperial Government of China issued bonds in 1911 to
help construct a section of the socalled Hukuang railroad in
an agreement with British, German, French and American banks.
    According to court documents, payments on the loan were
made until the mid1930s, when China was torn by civil war. The
present government, which came to power in 1949, has never
acknowledged the debt.
     Nine U.S. bondholders sued China for repayment of the loan
in 1979, less than a year after the normalization of relations
between Washington and Peking.
    A U.S. District Court in Alabama in 1982 issued a judgment
that the bondholders were entitled to all unpaid interest and
principal on the bonds, totaling 41.3 mln dlrs.
    But a U.S. Court of Appeals last July vacated the award,
ruling that the Chinese government was entitled to sovereign
immunity, and dismissed the lawsuit.
    Supported by the Reagan administration, China argued that
it could not be held liable for a debts involving bonds issued
in 1911 and that it enjoyed absolute immunity.
    The Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear an
appeal by the bondholders seeking to reinstate their lawsuit.

<TITLE>GENERAL CINEMA ltGCN> POOR SEASON LOWERS NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHESNUT HILL, Mass., March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>General Cinema Corp said
lower attendence at its theatres against last years record
Christmas season lowered its first fiscal quarter operating
earnings nine pct to 15.9 mln dlrs.
    "While we are not off to as good a start in fiscal 1987 as
we would like, business has picked up in the last few weeks,"
chairman Richard Smith said.
    He said that the company expected net pricing to be higher
and unit volume to improve in the remaining quarters of the
fiscal year.
    The company added that operating earnings in its theatre
unit will be higher in fiscal 1987 if the important summer
season film releases perform well.
    In addition, its other key business, General Cinema
Beverages, is expected to achieve record operating results for
the full year, Smith said.
    The companys superstar video business which rents video
cassettes in supermarkets continues to operate at an expected
loss, the company added.
    General Cinema said the financing costs associated with its
purchase of 3.5 mln Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc ltCHH> shares
for 177.9 mln dlrs, and its 89.7 mln sterling investment in
ltCadbury Schweppes PLC>, lowered first quarter net.
    But it said the loss was offset by a 2.5 mln dlr gain on
the sale of common shares of SeaLand Corp, a unit of CSX Corp
ltCSX>.

divisions to Montrealbased Taurus Footwear Inc for
undisclosed terms.
    The divisions manufacture and distribute Greb, Hush
Puppies, Kodiak, and Santana brand shoes and had revenues of
about 69 mln dlrs last year, Warrington said. It said the sale
of the shoe divisions and the previous sale of its ski boot
businesses will result in an unspecified net gain.
    Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its Canstar
Sports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, the
largest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Western
world.
    Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of
its ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment
loss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its
shoe and ski boot divisions.
    Taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase its
annual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it Canadas largest
footwear manufacturer.

<TITLE>CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Board of Trade CBT
agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a
period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes
ahead with planned renovation.
    A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a
number of options to identify the most cost effective and
efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve
moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the
nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.
    "One of CBT Chairman Karsten Mahlmanns agenda items has
been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"
the spokesman said.
    Another CBT official, executive vice president George
Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a
special meeting on the exchange floor.
    A number of presentations have been made with regard to
renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "Weve
looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such
things as flipflopping the trading rooms," he added.
    It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we
might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT
markets, Sladoje said.
    "If we move out of one floor entirely, then the
construction period will be about a year," he said, adding that
the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then
be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.
    The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very
preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until
this summer at the earliest.
    In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,
exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary
home next door in the present grainsdominated area.
    This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond
futures, Treasury Notes, Munibonds, and options on TBonds and
TNotes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the
MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,
soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.
    Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT
members.
    One senior floor trader said the financial futures room
badly needs renovating.
    "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and
the financials will move to the grains area," he said.
    The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was
to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a
time. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way to
proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering
drawings," he said.
    He added that it was difficult at present to determine an
exact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a major
undertaking and a process that would spread out over next
year," he said.
    Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which
merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing
to vacate their floor at the end of this month.
    Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by
moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved
for lightlytraded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share
their trading area.
    The MidAm specializes in minicontracts in grains,
livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as
some options contracts.
    "Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here
because the bonds are too crowded," one MidAm trader said.
    Another source at the MidAm said this change could take
place by July or August.

<TITLE>GROUP SEEKS PRIME MEDICAL ltPMSI> HOLDER LIST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A group of investment firms led by
Far Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is seeking
information about the shareholders of Prime Medical Services
Inc, over which it has said it is seeking control.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, which includes Shamrock Associates, included a March
6 letter to Prime which asks for a complete list of all
shareholders and their addresses.
    The group said it wants the information so it can contact
shareholders on issues, including election of an opposition
slate of directors to the board and other proxy contests.
    The Koether groups letter gives the company five days to
respond to its request. If there is no response from Prime
Medical, the group said it would consider the demand refused
and would take "other proper steps" to get the information.
    The group said it already holds 1,483,886 Prime Medical
shares, or 17.5 pct of the total. It said it has taken legal
action to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and
require all directors to stand for election.
    In a previous SEC filing, the group has said it has decided
to try to seek control of Prime Medical through a tender offer,
exchange offer, proxy contest or other ways.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER ltC> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corps proposed acquisition of
American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
American Motor debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
    They said Chryslers cost of acquisition was valued at  782
mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his companys
agreement with Renault to assume AMCs debt as well as 332 mln
dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
included valuing the transaction.
    Analysts were generally positive on Chryslers proposed
purchase of its muchsmaller rival, but said they expected the
transaction would carry with it a shortterm dilution in
Chryslers earnings.
    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chryslers ability to
assume AMCs large reserve of taxloss carryforwards
accumulated from its losses since 1980.
    "There were very serious discussions last fall but we
didnt pull it off," the source said in a reference to the
assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
Besse.
    "Its too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
And Renault could have gotten a much better price if wed done
it before the end of last year."
    In addition to AMCs debt and its pension liabilities, the
source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhang
to the company."
    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
in the form of a 10year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
dlrs cash for Renaults equity in AMCs finance subsidiary, 25
mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with the
acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
AMC shareholders.
    "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"
analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
     Moodys Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMCs
liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
debt that is being carried at "nonmarket" rates.
    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
were committed to the groups business plan of which AMC was an
integral part.
    "The new management didnt have that problem  AMC wasnt
their baby," he said.

<TITLE>BANKS TO MULL PHILIPPINE DEBT PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines bank advisory
committee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novel
proposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the
countrys interest bill with investment notes instead of cash,
bankers said.
    Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12bank advisory
committee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
    Bankers declined to comment on todays meeting but said the
panels response could be crucial to the fate of the talks,
which are now in their second week. "The balls in our court
now," one banker on the committee said.
    Under Ongpins rescheduling plan, the Philippines would
offer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over the
London Interbank Offered Rate.
    Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would be
offered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a margin
of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes, PINs,
bankers explained.
    These tradable, dollardenominated zerocoupon notes would
have a maturity of six years, but they would be redeemable at
any time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as part
of the governments debtequity scheme.
    Because banks would be able to sell the PINs to
multinational investors at relatively small discounts to face
value, their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8
pct cash margin, according to the Philippine proposal.
    Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment in
the Philippines, the PINs idea is likely to run into stiff
resistance by at least some members of the bank advisory
committee because it would establish the precedent of some
interest payments being made with paper rather than cash.
    Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants had
given a green light to his idea, but bankers are not so sure.
    U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to account
for the notes in the same way as accruing cash interest
payments and that their profits would suffer accordingly.
    If the banks reject the proposal out of hand, however, they
run the risk of scuttling the talks, for Ongpin has insisted
that he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct.
    The Phillipines is asking the banks to reschedule 3.6
billion dlrs of debt falling due between 1987 and 1992 and to
grant easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previously
restructured debt.

<TITLE>MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, MARCH 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Grain analysts said the increase of
three mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to
affect the market Tuesday.
    They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet
imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought
one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan
administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets
U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.
    In its supplydemand report, the USDA raised its estimate
for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.
    "That was business already done, for all practical
purposes," said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,
reflecting similar statements made by other analysts.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>ltGull Air Inc> said it filed an
antitrust suit against Texas Air Corp, charging the airline
broke a marketing agreement and undertook predatory business
practices aimed at shutting down Gull Air.
    Gull Air, flying commerical routes in some 20 cities in the
Northeast, Florida and the Bahamas, said it reached a feeder
agreement with Texas Air Corp in March 1986.
    Under the five year marketing pact, Gull said it
coordinated its flights with Texas Air, Continental, Eastern
and New York Air, to facilitate connections and increase its
business.
    But when Texas Air acquired People Express Inc and its
units, including Bar Harbor Air Line and ProvincetownBoston
Airline, the privatelyheld Gull became a competitor to the
Texas Air units, the company said.
    The company said Texas Air then broke the five year
agreement previously reached with Gull, causing it to lose
millions of dollars.
    A company spokesman said Gull has not yet set a monetary
value on the amount on the damages it is seeking in the suit.

<TITLE>REAGAN EXTENDS U.S. COOPERATION WITH EURATOM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan signed an order 
allowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European Atomic
Energy Community EURATOM to continue for a further year, even
though they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law.
    Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread of
nuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must
get American consent to any reprocessing.
    The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11
rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear
cooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, to
conform with the 1978 law.
    Since 1978 the U.S.EURATOM nuclear coooperation accords
have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders.
    State Department officials said negotiations had made more
progress in the last two years after the United States had
offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement, rather
than requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fuel
delivery.
     In notifying Congress of todays order extending
U.S.EURATOM nuclear cooperation, Reagan said "A disruption of
nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of
progress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements,
it would also cause serious problems in our relationships."
      He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was 
expected this year.

<TITLE>FUTURE OF EC BUTTER DISPOSAL SCHEME IN DOUBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid the
European Community EC of one mln tonnes of surplus butter is
in doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their opposition
to the scheme, diplomats said.
    The plan, proposed by the Communitys executive Commission,
aims to level most of the ECs huge and costly butter mountain
by disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next.
    But the officials said Spain and Portugal, which joined the
12nation bloc at the beginning of last year, continued to
oppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here.
    They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal of
surpluses created before they became EC members.
    The plan, already approved by farm ministers despite
opposition from Madrid and Lisbon, had been sent to finance
ministers for final approval.
    But the diplomats said the finance ministers instead
referred it back to the Commission, asking it to study possible
ways to solve the row as soon as possible.
    They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to the
European Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission did
not come up with a satisfactory solution.
    The scheme has also run into criticism from the ECs
financial watchdog, the Court of Auditors.
    The Court has said the plan is unsound because the
Commission wants member states to foot the bill until it starts
reimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989.
    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the courts view
and also complained that, under complex financial agreements
worked out when they joined the EC, they would get less back
later than if they were reimbursed now.
    Commission sources said it appeared the two countries were
holding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation out
of their partners but it was unclear how much longer they would
continue to block the scheme.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Iredale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>A confidential World Bank report on the
Peruvian economy has said the governments strategy does not
offer good prospects for medium and longterm growth and is
likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.
    The report, published today by the economic monthly, The
Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcias
government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth
in gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains in
the short term at the expense of the long."
    Government officials had no immediate comment on the
report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the
public investment program and greater emphasis on the
preservation of Perus export potential.
    The report said that although the government had succeeded
in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of
1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation
program was encountering rising difficulties.
    "An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to
monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of
price controls, appears not improbable," it added.
    The world bank report said the governments policies had
reduced inflation and shortterm increases in consumption at
the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the
currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,
and sharply diminished creditworthiness.
    It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a
competitive exchange rate and control the public sector
deficit, "the higher the probability will be that the government
will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of
domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further
controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the
balance of payments."
    It said the bank would place more emphasis on the
preservation of perus export potential, external links and
overall economic efficiency.
    The governments incentive policies towards the mining and
petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports,
suggested that it did not accord high priority to their
economic viability, it added.

<TITLE>LINDNER SAYS HE DISCUSSED CONTROL OF TAFT ltTFB></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a
16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and
Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the
possibility of seeking control of it.
    Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls
American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Tafts
managers and directors have been aimed at "achieving an
increased ownership position" in the company.
    Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either
by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in
a group to acquire the company.
    Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American
Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.
    He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to
any agreements or understandings.
    But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in
Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
regarding the future control and direction of Taft.
    Lindners investor group recently raised its Taft stake to
1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6
pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
    Although he recently received clearance from the Federal
Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,
Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not
seeking to control the company.
    An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bass
family of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct of
Tafts common stock.

<TITLE>N.Z. FOREIGN DEBT FALLS TO 32.94 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealands total foreign debt
fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the quarter end December 31
against 33.42 billion in the quarter end September 30, revised
from 33.12 billion dlrs, and 24.61 billion in the quarter end
March 1985, the statistics department said.
    The department began releasing quarterly figures in June
1986.
    It said in a statement Government Corporation foreign debt
in the December quarter fell to 5.86 billion against a 6.78
billion in the September quarter, revised from 6.63 billion and
5.25 billion in March quarter 1985.
    Private sector foreign debt fell to 5.75 billion dlrs from
5.89 billion, revised from 5.74 billion, and 5.45 billion in
March 1985.
    Government departments and Reserve Bank foreign debt rose
to 21.32 billion against 20.75 billion and 13.92 billion.
    Contributing to the total fall of 0.48 billion dlrs were
2.11 billion in net realised and unrealised exchange gains, a
result of an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar against
other currencies, the department said.
    The U.S. Dollar remained the predominant borrowing currency
for all three sectors in the economy at December 31.

<TITLE>U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. authorities intervened in the
foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion
during the period between the start of November 1986 and the
end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a
report.
    The Feds quarterly review of foreign exchange operations
said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen
on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese
monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the
U.S. Treasury.
    The Feds intervention was on the morning after president
Reagans State of the Union message and was "in a manner
consistent with the joint statement" made by U.S. Treasury
secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi
Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations.
    At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to
cooperate on exchange rate issues.
    The Feds report did not say at what level the intervention
occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen
after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It
had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day.
    The dollar had plumbed a postWorld War II low of 149.98
yen on January 19 and reached a sevenyear low of 1.7675 marks
on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks.
    The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout
November and the first half of December, the dollar moved
sharply lower until the end of January.
    It closed the threemonth review period down more than 11
pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and
seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen
four pct against the Canadian dollar.
    During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar
subsided. Reports of the U.S.Japanese intervention operation
and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial
countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on
exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said.
    Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.
interest rates. The dollars swift fall had raised questions
about whether the Fed would let shortterm rates ease.
    Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks
and 153.70 yen. According to the Feds tradeweighted index, it
had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period.
    The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in
early November.
    The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on
November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth
of marks and yen.
    The Feds action followed the September 1985 Plaza
agreement between the five major industrial nations under which
they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar.

<TITLE>USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union will likely honor
its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four
mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department
official said.
    "They have always honoured the agreement, and theres no
reason now to think they wont this year," he told Reuters.
    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European
Community, from Canada, from the U.S. Theyre active buyers
from all sources at this point," the official said in
explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports
estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.
    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when
analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for
the first time in 15 years.
    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern
over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.
corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscows
recent interest.
    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying
countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,
and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the
official said.
    "The Soviets will try to outcapitalize the capitalists"
and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "As
soon as they need corn, theyll buy it," he added.
    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the
Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the
purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.
    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets
would enter the U.S. market again.
    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set  from the
situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of
frenetic buying now," the official said.
    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," he
said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase
commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet
purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.
    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.
is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to
the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.

<TITLE>PICKENS SEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN WORKING RIGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     DALLAS, March 9  </DATELINE><BODY>T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and
financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service
industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were
once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.
     Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to
below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will
eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.
     Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S.,
down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985
to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The
highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.
     "The rigs wont go back to work until the price of oil
gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to
see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs
operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58.
     Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting
his autobiography "Boone," said he does not believe the U.S.
should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the
domestic oil industry.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN WAGE RISE SET AT 10 DLRS A WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>The Arbitration Commission awarded
the Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increase
and allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a secondtier
increase of up to four pct, Commission President Justice Barry
Maddern said here.
    The decision is effective from the next pay period of
individual employers, he said in delivering the Commissions
National Wage Case decision.
    Fulltime adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00
dlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, according
to latest official statistics.
    The wage decision is the first under the previously
announced twotier system which replaced the concept of wage
indexation. It is the first national wage rise since a
partiallyindexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by the
Commission last July.
    The decision is a compromise between the Federal
governments call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weekly
rise plus a three pct secondtier ceiling and the Australian
Council of Trade Unions ACTU claim of 20 dlrs and up to four
pct.
    Employer groups had sought no rise at all.
    The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case in
October to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pct
should be awarded, Maddern said.
    He said the success of the new system depended on the
commitment of all parties  employers, unions and governments.
    He said the Commission had rejected employers calls for a
freeze on overall labour cost increases.
    "We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given the
needs and expectations of wage and salary earners, he said,
adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of a
cooperative effort to lift Australias economic performance.
    The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciation
of the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade would
not be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said.
    If necessary, it would arbitrate secondtier claims at an
implementation rate of no more than two pct from September this
year and a further two pct from July 1988, he said.
    He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the life
of the package, adding that secondtier rises will be mainly
achieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, covering
elimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiency
and productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes.
    Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for a
cut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers to
be exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe or
extreme economic adversity.
    The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in its
last decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious.
    "The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in the
economy which underlines the economic circumstances must be
allayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around.
In this connection, what happens to labour costs is of critical
importance," he said.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND FOREIGN DEBT EXPECTED TO KEEP FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealands total foreign debt
will continue to decline as major energy projects are
refinanced, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.
    Statistics Department figures show total debt fell to 32.94
billion N.Z. Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion in
September, although the governments share rose to 21.32
billion from 20.75 billion.
    Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting of
reserves to refinance socalled "Think Big" projects.
    "These reserves do not add to New Zealands total
indebtedness.... They are money in the bank," he said.
    "As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project are
completed, existing loans will be replaced with debt currently
held in reserves for this purpose," Douglas added.
    This in turn will result in a drop in quasigovernment and
private debt, he said.
    He said refinancing of projects allowed the government to
borrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debts
more effectively.
    "Both of these will reduce the cost of Think Big to the
taxpayer over time," he said. "The refinancing also paves the way
to deregulation of the oil industry."

<TITLE>RUBBER LEAF DISEASE SEEN AFFECTING SUPPLY/PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>The leaf disease corenes pora,
which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and
Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up
depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said.
    Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved
and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection
and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of
Malaysia RRIM, told Reuters.
    He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes
pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lankas plantations and may cause
output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
    The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute
may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the
disease and added that most estates affected belong to the
State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects
certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that
further use of such clones must be discontinued.
    Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research
Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesias PPN 2058, 2444,
2447 and PR 265 and Malaysias RRIM 725, he said.
    Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725
clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed
after use of such clones were discontinued.
    Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also
affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience
has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.
    "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not
curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may
drop and prices can rise," he said.
    He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in
Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation.

<TITLE>JAPAN AUCTIONS 1,000 BILLION YEN SHORTTERM PAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>Japans Finance Ministry auctioned 1,000
billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debtfinancing paper,
to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19, a
spokesman said.
    The last tankoku auction, on February 12, produced a record
low yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half point
cut in Japans discount rate, he said.
    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four major
Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in
an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional
investors, securities managers said.
    Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well
again this time as securities houses will try to expand their
inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from
institutional investors.
    Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, shortterm
interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for
funds ahead of the March 31 financial yearend, they said.
    The Bank of Japan has been trying to dampen money market
rates to make the latest discount rate cut effective, but so
far in vain, dealers said.
    The auction results will be announced tomorrow.

<TITLE>SEARCH FOR BRITISH FERRYS TOXIC CARGO CONTINUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZEEBRUGGE, Belgium, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>The search continued for a
cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of
Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour
Friday.
    A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were
loaded on trucks in the ships hold have been recovered, but
Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a
further 61 containers of a cyanidebased solution.
    A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the
front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.
    Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the
wreck of the 7,951 ton rollon, rolloff ferry which now lies
partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.
    The ferrys owner is ltEuropean Ferries Plc>, majority owned
by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc ltPORL.L>.
    The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after
divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it
could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies
estimated to be trapped amid debris.
    "The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect
one working day out of four," said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch
Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He
estimated the job itself would require 35 working days.
    Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise
the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.
    Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of
the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying crossChannel
routes from England to continental Europe.
    Suspicion at present is focused on the ferrys main vehicle
loading doors, set close to water level.
    In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament
yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in
through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into
the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from
Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit
lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.
    Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine
how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ships
doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.
    Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun,
one Belgian and one by the ferrys owners.

<TITLE>SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW 1987 GAINS IN U.S. TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>There is little chance Soviet exports
to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscows current
trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods
in future, a Soviet economist said.
    Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an
agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a
U.S.USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items
that western nations want.
    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and
allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage
modest export gains in future.
    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of
goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion
dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.
    But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total
trade between the two countries would remain between two and
three billion dlrs a year.
    "The postdetente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit
its trading with the U.S.," he said.

any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against
drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and
manpower, the Peoples Daily domestic edition said.
    Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.
    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst
for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in
100 counties in Sichuan, the countrys biggest agricultural
producer.
    Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees
Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less
than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oilbearing
crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.
    The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in
Guangdong are seriously short of water.
    The Peoples Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are
also suffering from drought.
    Henans grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from
the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese microchip makers are being
strongarmed into compliance with a U.S.Japan pact on
semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japans
market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry MITI, which is pressuring
the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
breathing space, they said.
    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
to get things done," said Bache Securities Japan associate
vice president Peter Wolffe.
    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
to the pacts price controls.
    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
jeopardy because of continued dumping in nonAmerican markets
and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
said it would cut production in line with MITIs request.
    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITIs
demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once
NEC cuts production, it means they all have."
    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon
Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
Aizawa said.
    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
restrictions, some industry officials said.
    "Its like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head
of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another
opens."
    MITIs pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
shrugged off MITI guidance.
    "Its getting to be like communism," said one.
    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
    "Theyre going to have to start running their businesses
like businesses," Baches Wolffe said.
    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
urging chip users to buy foreignmade chips, but U.S. Industry
officials said response has been mixed at best.
    "There has been some change, but its not across the board,"
said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of
urgency."
    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM dynamic
random access memory chips could merely speed the transition
to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
said.
    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
    "The SIA U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association doesnt
even have an office here," a source close to the industry said.
"You could question just how committed they are."
    In addition, some industry analysts question the
effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
    "South Koreas gaining market share," said one analyst.
"Theyre the real winners from the agreement."

<TITLE>JAPAN TANKOKU YIELDS HIT RECORD LOW AT AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry said its auction
yesterday of 1,000 billion yen of tankoku, sixmonth debt
financing paper, produced a record low average yield of 3.246
pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses.
    The tankoku mature on September 21, 1987.
    The previous record low was 3.383 pct at the last auction,
on February 12.
    One of four major Japanese securities house bought 39.5 pct
of the total 1,021.1 billion yen in bids accepted, ministry
sources said.
    Securities houses bid aggressively as big retail accounts,
such as tokkin, special money trust and trust funds have been

shortterm fund management, securities house managers said.
    The yield for tankoku, issued on a discount basis, is one
point below the 4.26/12 pct interest rates for sixmonth
certificates of deposit today.
    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, the four
majors took 92 pct of the issue to increase their tankoku
inventory, the managers said.
    Bids totalled 1,975.8 billion yen.
    The average price was 98.36 to give a yield of 3.246 pct
and lowest was 98.33, giving 3.314 pct, the Ministry said.

<TITLE>SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said there is little room left for the central bank to further
ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now
approaching their lower limit.
    "The government should instead seek ways of making the best
use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.
    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic
stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming
days.
    At the recent talks among the six major industrialised
nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive
economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would
help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.
    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in
the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.
    He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market
against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains
the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting
economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening
market activity, he added.

Irans forces in the mountains of northeast Iraq.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the commander in the

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese crushers are likely to buy at
least 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and
another 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditions
are good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.
    A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000
tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.
    "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a
bushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, it
is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their
buying volume," one source said. Brazilian beans are available
to Japan for shipment from May to July.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN METAL TRADER LINKS TO ASTURIANA DE ZINC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRISBANE, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>ltMetal Traders Australasia Ltd> said a
newlyformed subsidiary, the ltAustmet Ltd> group, has
negotiated an exclusive longterm contract with Spains
ltAsturiana de Zinc> to market its zinc metal exports.
    Metal Traders said in a statement the contract would
underpin the worldwide zinc, copper and lead trading activities
of Austmet, a whollyowned Londonbased company with a U.S.
Unit in Stamford, Connecticut.
    Austmet has recruited a group of base metal traders,
currently operating out of Britain and the U.S., Who have
handled Asturianas business for the past five years, it said.
    Asturiana has a threeyear option to purchase 25 pct of the
Austmet group, to be priced on an independent valuation at the
time of exercise, Metal Traders said.
    Austmet will have an initial equity base of one mln stg, a
turnover of 200 mln Australian dlrs rising to 300 mln in the
first year, and credit lines of up to 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
    Austmet should be generating profits from July 1 and a
1.52.5 mln dlr net is envisaged within two years, it said.
    Metal Traders said Asturiana has the largest zinc smelting
capacity in Europe  nearly 200,000 tonnes a year of 99.995
pct highgrade zinc, at Aviles in northern Spain.
    Metal Traders, a listed company, was formerly ltPyrotech
Resources N.L.> whose chief activity was the development and
marketing of hightechnology smelting processes invented in
Australia, notably the Siromelt Zinc Fuming Process.
    But in late 1986, control of the company changed and it
expanded by acquisition into metal trading in Australia and
Asia. It then changed its name.
    It also has the marketing contract for mineral sands
produced by ltTiO2 Corp N.L.>, of which it holds 17.5 pct.
    In todays statement, Metal Traders also said it is
reviewing possible acquisition of a mineral producer.

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIAS KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By STEPHEN JUKES AND PHILIP SHEHADI, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants
oil price stability and he called on nonOPEC producers to
avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.
    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television
news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make
to Britain later this month.
    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln
barrels per day bpd to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
agreed to by OPEC last December.
    The King replied "Saudi Arabia doesnt decide prices by
itself but certainly desires price stability."
    NonOPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common
interest so that there is no type of competition which could
prove harmful to everyone," he said.
    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first
step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not
for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
benchmark.
    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,
due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd
said Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest oil exporter, was
adhering to decisions made at OPECs December conference which
set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.
    A major nonOPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the
groups pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.
    The King also urged the world community to help the
Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful
end to the IranIraq war. The 61/2yearold war could not be
resolved on the battlefield, he said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>ltNissan Motor Manufacturing UK Ltd> has
reached agreement with ltLombard North Central Plc> of the U.K.
To build plants and boost the local content in Nissans U.K.
Produced cars to 60 pct in 1988 from 40 to 50 pct, the Nissan
Motor Co Ltd ltNSAN.T> said.
    The agreement will allow the cars to be designated as
domestically manufactured rather than imported vehicles, Nissan
said. The agreement was reached through negotiations with the
British government and the European Community EC after they
threatened to impose duties on imports.
    According to the 230 mln stg contract, Lombard North
Central, an affiliate of National Westminster Bank Plc
ltNWBL.L>, will build and lease plants for engine assembly, body
panel pressing and resin moulding by 1988. They will be near
the existing Nissan plant in Sunderland in northeast England,
Nissan said. The Sunderland plant currently produces 24,000
Bluebird cars annually for the British market.
    Nissan hopes to begin U.K. Exports to Europe in 1991 after
building an engine machining plant which would boost output to
100,000 units a year and local content to above 80 pct, in
accordance with EC requests, the spokesman said.

ltKFHG.F> is considering taking a stake in shipping and
transport group HapagLloyd AG ltHPLG.F> but has yet to reach a

    Press reports said Kaufhof wanted a stake of up to 12.5 pct
in HapagLloyd.
    The Kaufhof spokesman noted any decision on purchasing
shares in the shipping group would have to be approved by the
supervisory board, which is due to hold a meeting tomorrow.
    Late last year the Gevaert group of Belgium and West
Germanys VEBA AG ltVEBG.F> said they had each acquired a 12.5
pct stake in HapagLloyd from Deutsche Bank AG ltDBKG.F> and
Dresdner Bank AG ltDRSD.F>.
     Industry sources estimate Deutsche and Dresdner,
HapagLloyds majority shareholders, held about 75 pct of
HapagLloyds share capital before selling portions of it to
Gevaert and VEBA.
    The two banks have said they eventually wanted to reduce

<TITLE>HILLSDOWN SAYS EARLY 1987 RESULTS ENCOURAGING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Hillsdown Holdings Plc ltHLDN.L> said
early results for 1987 were encouraging, and the combination of
its investment and acquisition strategies enabled it to look
forward confidently for an excellent result for the year.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which showed
pretax profit rising to 54.9 mln stg from 33.4 mln previously
on turnover that lifted to 1.70 billion from 1.13 billion.
    The figures initially boosted the share price to 286p from
281p last night, but they then eased back to 283p by 0830 GMT.
    Hillsdown said capital expenditure rose in 1986 to 60 mln
stg from 31.5 mln and would continue at this high level in
1987.
    The placing of 82.5 mln shares last year raised 160.7 mln
stg and enabled shareholders funds to more than double to 352
mln at yearend.
    Net borrowings were 20 pct of shareholders funds and the
group had listed investments of 47.1 mln.
    The company said it had bought a total of 40 companies
during the year for a total price of some 180 mln stg. Although
these had made minor contribution to profits the real benefits
would come in 1988 and beyond.

<TITLE>IRAQ SAYS IT CRUSHED IRANIAN ATTACK IN NORTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its forces had crushed
an Iranian attack on a strategic mountain peak in a rugged and
snowclad area of Iraqi Kurdistan.
    The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was
repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps 96th Brigade on
"Karda Ku" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and
340 kms north of Baghdad.
    INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large
quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not
give Iraqi casualties.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi
troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Irans weekold
offensive in northeast Iraq.
    Iran attacked across snowcapped peaks of northeastern Iraq
last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid1983.
    The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraqs
second city on the southern front of the 61/2yearold
conflict, after an Iranian crossborder offensive launched on
January 9.
    The political department head at Iraqs Defence Ministry,
Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in
the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.
    He said Tehran had done this "to make up for failure in the
south and to encourage antiBaghdad Kurdish rebels to support
its troops."
    Tehran has supported antiBaghdad Kurdish guerrillas in
operations against government positions and installations in
northern Iraq.

<TITLE>NIPPON OIL SEES SHARPLY LOWER SALES AND PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Nippon Oil Co Ltd ltNPOL.T> predicted
parent company net profit of about nine billion yen in the year
ending March 31, down 10.4 pct from a year earlier, president
Yasuoki Takeuchi told a press conference.
    Current profit for the year was estimated at 17 to 18
billion yen, down 20 to 24 pct from a year earlier, he said.
    Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1,700
billion yen for the fifth consecutive yearonyear drop. This
years fall was due to lower selling prices for endusers,
which more than offset the yens appreciation. The company will
retain six yen dividend for 1986/87.

<TITLE>U.K. ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE EXHAUSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion stg tranche of 83/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997 was exhausted in very early
trading on the U.K. Government bond market only minutes after
becoming available for trading, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue, announced on Monday and
available for official dealings from this morning, was no
longer operating as a tap. The striking price was a partly paid
41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.
    Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for the
bonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulated
by sterlings surge at the opening this morning.
    The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seen
as a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for a
further U.K. Interest rate reduction following the halfpoint
cut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier in
the day.
    Dealers said that the Banks strategy succeeded in stemming
pressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as the
market yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on Monday
immediately after the announcement.
    Demand for the issue was lively from U.K. And overseas
sources, with particular interest seen from Japan.
    The bonds were issued at a price of 9616/32 stg pct,
partly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although the
Government broker this morning sold them at a premium of one
stg pct over the partly paid issue price.
    The issue has been designated the "B" tranche of the bonds,
since 1.3 billion stg of 83/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997
is already in issue.
    Dealers noted that the Bank of England last week issued one
billion stg of nine pct Exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effort
to dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused by
sterlings uptrend on foreign exchange markets.
    Last weeks issue was sold out on its first day of dealings
but with nothing resembling the determined demand seen this
morning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said.
    After stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, the
authorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on Monday,
following it up with the announcement of the one billion stg
bond issue.
    Sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but this
morning opened very strongly again, starting on a
tradeweighted basis at 72.6 against yesterdays final 72.1 and
later edging up to 72.7.
    U.K. Money market rates declined again this morning by up
to 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterdays speculation that
clearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figures
after the budget next Tuesday, money market dealers said.
    U.K. Government bond dealers noted that under the influence
of stronger sterling and the further fall in money market
rates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 point
higher at the longer end of the market.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The yens rise against the dollar is
expected to boost Japans unemployment rate to an average 3.3
pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from Januarys
record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.
    The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.
    The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast
unemployment would exceed two mln by midfiscal 1987, against
an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.
    Nomura urged the government to take pumppriming measures
to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
    Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
machinery sectors, Nomura said.
    Employment in the nonmanufacturing sector will continue to
increase, the institute said, without giving figures.

<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
liquidity shortage of around 300 mln stg in the market today.
    Among the main factors, the Bank said bills maturing in
official hands and the treasury bill takeup would drain 483
mln stg from the system while below target bankers balances
and a rise in the note circulation would take out 50 mln and
100 mln stg respectively.
    Partially offsetting these, exchequer transactions would
add around 355 mln stg, the Bank added.

<TITLE>JAPAN O CURB VEHICLE EXPORTS TO EC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese car makers will curb their
exports to the European Community EC following an unofficial
directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
MITI, automobile industry sources said.
    Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to
be at most unchanged from last years 1.10 mln units and may
even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic
growth and increasing trade friction.
    Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairs
Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to
exercise prudence in exporting to Europe.
    Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to
build up depleted vehicle inventories, industry sources said.
    Japans vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pct
from a year earlier to 174,133 units.
    In December, exports fell 70.4 pct yearonyear as makers
curbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI to
limit 1986 exports, they said.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK LOANS TO CHINA SEEN DOUBLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Lending by the World Bank and its soft
loan arm, the International Development Agency IDA, to China
is expected to almost double to about two billion dlrs by
1989/90 from the levels of 1984 to 1986, foreign bankers told
Reuters.
    They said approved lending in 1986/87 JulyJune is
expected to total 1.4 billion dlrs, of which 550 mln will come
from the IDA and 850 mln from the World Bank.
    World Bank figures show approved lending to China by the
two bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86, 1.102 billion
in 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84.
    The bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursed
by the end of 1986 and Chinas disbursement record compares
very favourably with that of other countries.
    They said Japan has so far been the main source of
bilateral concessional assistance for China, followed by West
Germany, Canada, Italy, Australia and Britain.
    But China will probably find that such funds will not
increase, except for those from Japan and the World Bank, given
other claims, particularly from subSaharan African countries
which cannot raise commercial credits, they added.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  CHINAS FOREIGN DEBT UP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark ONeill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Chinas foreign debt reached 27 billion
dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an overexposure to
shortterm credits and yen borrowing, China remains very
creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign
bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.
    Foreign bankers said Chinas total debt rose sharply from
an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end1985 to cover increased
import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,
between eight and 10 pct.
    China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.
    Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan
agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on
1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.
    Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in
the 198690 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said
they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.
    A Western banker said Chinas portfolio contains too much
shortterm debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a
result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive
low interest rates in the Japanese market.
    The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is
likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.
    A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the
countrys total debt at about 30 pct.
    The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house
said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.
    "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,
which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go
elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he
said.
    The Western banker said the excess of shortterm loans is
in part a result of Chinas inexperience in the foreign capital
markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.
    "Officials do not think of China but of their own department
or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the
full backing of the Peoples Republic of China," he said.
    "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other
areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable
autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to
exercise indirect controls," he said.
    The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the
past six weeks that Chinas foreign borrowing will not be
affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase
meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.
    A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that Chinas
foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially
stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.
    "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the
market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in
advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.
    The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things
are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in
1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."
    Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9
billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.
    A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official
said this years outlook for exports, which account for more
than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier
than a year ago.
    The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It
was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.
    The official said China has taken measures to improve its
export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and
the establishment of export production bases.
    "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," he
added.
    Official estimates put Chinas 1986 export losses from the
drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.
    A Western diplomat said Chinas foreign debt needs careful
management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six
to eight pct.
    "We base our assessment not on Chinas foreign exchange
reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a
company on its performance, not its bank account," he said.
    He said China performed very well in the export field last
year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have
few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.

<TITLE>U.S. BANKS TO GET APPROVAL FOR SECURITIES BUSINESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Commercial banks are expected to
receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate
securities subsidiaries in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.
    A senior official at one of four prospective banks said the
ministry told his bank it would give approval as long as the
parent firm holds no more than 50 pct of the capital.
    "We expect the ministry to give us permission by the end of
April," he said.
    ltJ.P. Morgan and Co>, Bankers Trust New York Corp ltBT.N>,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp ltMHC.N> and Chemical New York Corp
ltFNBF.N> have asked for securities business licenses.
    Ministry officials declined to say when they would give
formal approval, but said they were working on the issue.
    Approval would pave the way for U.S. Commercial banks to
underwrite and trade equities in Japan under their own names.
    Citicorp ltCCI.N> and Chase Manhattan Corp ltCMB.N> have
already entered the Japanese securities market by acquiring
U.K. Securities houses already operating in Japan. Citicorp
took over ltVickers de Costa Ltd> and Chase bought ltLaurie
Milbank and Co>.
    Bankers did not know if all the banks would get licenses,
but said J.P. Morgan probably would as it was first to ask.

<TITLE>ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ultramar Plc ltUMAR.L> said that while
its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point
of view, several special charges adversely affected results.
    Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream
operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and
downstream operations also affected in the first half by large
losses on inventories.
    But margins improved in the second half and in particular
refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good
recovery.
    The company was commenting on results that showed a net
loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in
1985.
    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg
provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled
by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the companys liquid
natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership
of Gulf Canadas marketing assets.
    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a
further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a
withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a
13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its
U.S. Flag shipping operation.
    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain
although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase
in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic
prices would strengthen over the longer term.
    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put
it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.
    In the meantime, Ultramars objectives were to improve
profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while
strengthening core businesses and developing a sound
operational and financial base.
    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end1986 totalled
about 700 mln barrels net on an oilequivalent basis.
    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from
181p at last nights close.

declined to give an official reaction to reports that a group
of european operators plan to offer one mln tonnes of sugar
into intervention in protest at Commission export policies.
    However, a spokesman for the Commission confirmed the
offers had been made to intervention agencies in various member

agencies concerned to complete all necessary documentation.
    The spokesman said that under current regulations, the EC

    The spokesman said the Commission would only have to
reimburse the member state for the cost of buyingin the sugar
after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a

    He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held
in intervention stores.
    Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention and
during the 198485 campaign 108,000 tonnes.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Bill Tarrant, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A tight money market has pushed
interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between
15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.
    March is usually a tight month for the money market because
of tax payments and banks need to attract funds for their
yearend accounts on March 31.
    This year the situation has been made worse by Decembers
rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared
imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet
to be converted back into rupiah.
    "A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is
holding out until after April," one U.S. Banker said.
    The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
is helping to keep rates high.
    Shortterm lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no
prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.
    Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week
that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects
in 1987/88, but added the "speculators" who led a run on the
rupiah late last year could again pose problems.
    Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in
five years, and most businessmen expect no new government
economic packages or incentives before then.
    "Some people are nervous about what the government will do
after the election," one banker said. "They normally try to do
things before the IGGI InterGovernmental Group on Indonesia
meeting in June to prove they are doing something about the
economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars."
    The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries
and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft
loans and grants last year.

<TITLE>HIGHVELD HGVJ.J SEES LOWER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp
Ltd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last
years previously reported 85 cts a share.
    But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the company
said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.
    Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be
offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its
exports as the year progresses.
    Highveld said measures taken last year by the European
Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South
African steel products "presents a challenge to management to
place the steel in other areas."
    The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987
is expected to be similar to last year although Chinas role is
still an unknown factor in the total supplydemand situation.
    "World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be
adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand," it added.

<TITLE>NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
step down only after his plan to overhaul Japans tax system
gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said
today.
    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private
meeting, "Nakasones power in office does not necessarily
terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when
the seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."
    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite
Sundays unexpected Upper House byelection defeat of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP in a conservative
stronghold.
    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,
had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added
sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.
    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the
sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding
nothing but retraction of the tax.
    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the
1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax
plans. They have been resorting to an onoff boycott of
parliament since February 4.
   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular
parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice
summit of industrial democracies in June and open an
extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.
    Under law, a regular session can be extended only once
while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other
option would be to extend the current session, he said.
    "The opposition parties will surely present a noconfidence
motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."
    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up
the way for tax reform.
   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet
en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House
for a snap general election," the aide said.
    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign
from the 512seat Lower House, necessitating byelections.
    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its
landslide victory in general elections last July.
    There are five independents and three vacancies.
    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate
their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," the
aide said.
    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little
effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.
    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the
nations 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.
    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all
oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.
    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial
elections in Japans northernmost island of Hokkaido and
Fukuoka in southern Japan," he said.
    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

<TITLE>PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, West Germany, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Preussag
AG ltPRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company
would pay a dividend on 1986 results
    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has
frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
following a difficult year in 1985.
    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the
final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
the groups other divisions.
    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
partly on the level of provisions.
    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
additional factor behind the drop in results.
    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
would not begin to take full effect until this year.
    Preussags domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
majorityowned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
figures.
    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc AMC
subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
last year.
    AMCs large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
group losses that year.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Foreign oil companies will spend less
on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7
billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8
billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said.
    Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure
of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure
because of the crash in world oil prices.
    Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertaminas coordinating board for

exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against
108 and 330 last year.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations between Indonesias state
oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension
of the standard 30year production sharing contract will be
concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said.
    Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertaminas foreign contractors
coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the
talks.
    But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said
priority will be given to extending contracts for companies
whose exploration and production contracts expire within the
next seven to 10 years.
    Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the
negotiations would determine whether the 8515 production
sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or
altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.
    Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy
Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in
principle to extension of the standard 30year production
sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions
on the international oil market.

Eurotrust subsidiary is issuing a 228 mln dlr collateralised
mortgage obligation priced at par and yielding 40 basis points
over the threemonth London interbank offered rate Libor,
Salomon said as lead manager.
    However, interest, which is paid quarterly, cannot rise
above 11.50 pct.
    The stated maturity date of the issue is May 1, 2017, but
the deal has an expected life of 3.6 years which will vary with
the rate at which homebuyers prepay their mortgages
    The pool itself consists of Federal National Mortgage
Association Fannie Mae securities paying 10.50 pct.
    The issue settles on April 27 with no accrued interest.
    Salomon noted that the issue carries the lowest spread over
Libor of any CMO issued in the euromarkets to date.
    In explaining the pricing, a Salomon official noted that
there has been very heavy demand for highcoupon U.S.Agency
mortgage issues such as Fannie Maes and that the rising price
of the collateral must be passed along to investors.

<TITLE>TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Traders here and in Paris said the
results of todays EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast
because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and
Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into
intervention.
    London traders said bids for licences have been reported
between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences
are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that
range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.
    Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of
between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.
    Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,
the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London
traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate
volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales
into intervention in protest against EC export policies.
    Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a
maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.

<TITLE>KOREA PLANS TO OPEN MARKETS TO EASE WON PRESSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea will further open its market
to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off
pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government
spokesman said.
    The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha WoongBaes
stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial
nations to revalue the won underlined the governments
determination to stand firm.
    Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce "Demands that Korea
carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or
10 pct are, I believe, extremely illadvised."
    Deputy prime minister Kim MahnJe told a meeting of local
businessmen "The governments policy on the question of
revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."
    Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the
wons value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at
44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.
    Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that
newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and
Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.
    But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has
already reached "a crisis level."
    An official of the Korea Traders Association KTA said if
the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss
of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.
    "We are determined not to go the way of Latin American
debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their
debts," the spokesman said. "The only way to keep our good record
is to maintain our exports.
    The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the
won suddenly Korea would run "a tremendous trade deficit and
could degenerate into a country, like many other developing
countries, which is reneging on its international obligations."
    The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually
appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So
far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the
dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.
    He said South Korea was selecting "many" of 122 items on
which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help
narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were
given.
    Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158
items, including sensitive agricultural products and large
cars, effective from July.
    South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus
last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1
billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier
forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight
billion dlrs this year.
    But the government official said the surplus would be held
at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by
industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.

<TITLE>GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this weeks
securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
    But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
EMS are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
billion marks.
    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
    Banks minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
first nine days of March.
    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
the requirement toward the end of March.
    No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep
rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said.

    Krupp has said previously that the work force cuts are

<TITLE>CAPITAL MARKET BORROWING ONLY MODERATE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Borrowing on the international capital
markets rose moderately in February with 25.9 billion dlrs of
medium and long term funds raised, up 1.5 billion from January
and up 3.2 billion from February last year, the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.
    Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 20.8 billion
dlrs, some 2.8 billion more than in January, the OECD said in
its latest monthly report.
    But the market for floating rate notes FRNs saw further
serious difficulties and the volume of new offerings was only
1.4 billion dlrs against a 1986 monthly average of 4.2 billion.
    However, the OECD said, issues of straight bonds and
especially equityrelated issues continued at a brisk pace.
    As in January, exchange rate uncertainties had a major
impact on the currency composition of new bond issues, with
issues in dlrs totalling only 6.5 billion against a monthly
average of over 10 billion dlrs in 1986.
    "The share of the U.S. Dollar in total external bond
offerings has fallen below 32 pct this year  the lowest figure
in the present decade," the report said, but added that the
market has absorbed a record volume of yen offerings.
    In the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loans
declined to 3.9 billion dlrs in February from 4.7 billion in
January. Activity on the market for note issuance and other
backup facilities continued to be particularly subdued with a
total of only 1.2 billion dlrs completed in February, some 500
mln dlrs less than the already depressed figure for January.
    In February, OECD borrowers accounted for some 85 pct of
total borrowing with major borrowers including the U.S. With
4.5 billion dlrs, Japan, 3.1 billion, and France with two
billion, in addition to a one billion dlr refinancing for
electricity board EDF.

expected to boost Japans unemployment rate to an average 3.3
pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from Januarys

    The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.

    Nomura urged the government to take pumppriming measures
to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
    Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
machinery sectors, Nomura said.
    Employment in the nonmanufacturing sector will continue to
increase, the institute said, without giving figures.

<TITLE>SPAIN EXTENDS RESERVE REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain has extended the
reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds
in an attempt to curb speculation in shortterm capital which
is currently fuelling money supply growth.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject
to exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve
requirement with effect from Friday.
    Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from
reserve requirements.
    The measure comes one week after the central bank raised
reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage
point to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.
    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer
now  around eight pct for overnight funds  have attracted a
large influx of speculative foreign capital which is
threatening the governments monetary targets.
    They say this influx is largely responsible for Spains
principal measure of money supply, the broadbased liquid
assets in public hands ALP, to have grown by an estimated 17
pct annualised rate in February, compared with Januarys 8.3
pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The
target for 1987 is eight pct.
    The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to
banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money
market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly
Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Fridays hike in reserve
requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from
the system.
    The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest
rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterdays 13.46 pct
average for deposits.
    Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable
response "given that the market is short of funds."
    But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest
rates would neutralize the central banks attempts to curtail
shortterm speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish
money markets more attractive.

<TITLE>IRAQ SAYS IT CRUSHED IRANIAN ATTACK IN NORTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its forces had crushed
an Iranian attack on a strategic mountain peak in a rugged and
snowclad area of Iraqi Kurdistan.
    The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was
repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps 96th Brigade on
"Karda Ku" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and
340 kms north of Baghdad.
    INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large
quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not
give Iraqi casualties.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi
troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Irans weekold
offensive in northeast Iraq.
    Iran attacked across snowcapped peaks of northeastern Iraq
last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid1983.
    The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraqs
second city on the southern front of the 61/2yearold
conflict, after an Iranian crossborder offensive launched on
January 9.
    The political department head at Iraqs Defence Ministry,
Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in
the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.
    He said Tehran had done this "to make up for failure in the
south and to encourage antiBaghdad Kurdish rebels to support
its troops."
    Tehran has supported antiBaghdad Kurdish guerrillas in
operations against government positions and installations in
northern Iraq.

<TITLE>HUNGARY TO DEVALUE FORINT AGAINST WESTERN UNITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to devalue the forint by an
average of eight pct against Western currencies, the official
news agency MTI said.
    MTI did not say when the devaluation would become
effective, but it expected new rates to be announced later
today.
    Hungary devalued the forint by a similar amount last
September 23. Western bankers say the forint is more
realistically valued than currencies of Hungarys COMECON
allies.

<TITLE>DANISH BOND PRICES RISE AFTER AUSTERITY PLEDGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Prices rose on the Danish bond
market after Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said the government
was prepared to impose further austerity measures to limit
domestic consumption if the economy did not improve over the
summer.
    A typical 20year mortgage bond had risen to 81 by noon
from 791/4 at the close last night. "It is because of possible
optimism that the government will intervene if necessary," one
dealer told Reuters.
    Schlueter said after a routine cabinet meeting yesterday "If
economic tightening up is necessary, we will do it."
    The government has already imposed three austerity packages
since December 1985, in an attempt to bring down the external
current account deficit, which rose to a preliminary 34.5
billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion the previous year.
    Schlueter made clear that an autumn general election would
not make the government postpone any austerity measures. The
government has to call an election by January 1988.
    He expressed surprise at concern in some financial quarters
over the level of private and public wage settlements last
month, worth a minimum three to four pct a year. These would
lead to higher productivity, Schlueter said.

<TITLE>SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said there is little room left for the central bank to further
ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now
approaching their lower limit.
    "The government should instead seek ways of making the best
use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.
    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic
stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming
days.
    At the recent talks among the six major industrialised
nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive
economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would
help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.
    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in
the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.
    He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market
against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains
the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting
economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening
market activity, he added.

<TITLE>JAPAN TANKOKU YIELDS HIT RECORD LOW AT AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry said its auction
yesterday of 1,000 billion yen of tankoku, sixmonth debt
financing paper, produced a record low average yield of 3.246
pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses.
    The tankoku mature on September 21, 1987.
    The previous record low was 3.383 pct at the last auction,
on February 12.
    One of four major Japanese securities house bought 39.5 pct
of the total 1,021.1 billion yen in bids accepted, ministry
sources said.
    Securities houses bid aggressively as big retail accounts,
such as tokkin, special money trust and trust funds have been
showing strong interest in tankoku on increasing demand for
shortterm fund management, securities house managers said.
    The yield for tankoku, issued on a discount basis, is one
point below the 4.26/12 pct interest rates for sixmonth
certificates of deposit today.
    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, the four
majors took 92 pct of the issue to increase their tankoku
inventory, the managers said.
    Bids totalled 1,975.8 billion yen.
    The average price was 98.36 to give a yield of 3.246 pct
and lowest was 98.33, giving 3.314 pct, the Ministry said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA LEADING INDEX CONTINUES RISE IN DECEMBER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Westpac Banking Corp and the
Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social
Research said their leading index of Australian economic
activity rose for the ninth successive month in December.
    The index rose to 134.1 base 1980 from 129.8 in November
and 122.8 a year earlier, the WestpacInstitute report said.
    Annualised, it rose 13 pct in December against seven pct in
November and one pct a year earlier, based on the ratio of the
latest index to the average over the previous 12 months.
    The report said the index is now 12 points or 9.8 pct above
its trough in March 1986.
    Westpacs chief economist Bob Graham said the consistent
upward trend in the leading index emphasised the need for a
tough minibudget in May. "An untoward increase in consumption
spending before the balance of payments improves would have
disastrous consequences," he said.
    The coincident index also rose an annualised three pct in
December against zero movement in November and a seven pct rise
a year earlier, Westpac and the Institute said.
    They said this index continued to show the current
recession is shallow and is more likely to involve a slowing in
real growth than an absolute fall in economic activity.

<TITLE>JAPAN CANNOT BEAR FURTHER YEN RISE, MINISTER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan cannot bear a further rise of the
yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said.
    "A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and
the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," he
told reporters.
    The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders
of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.
    Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow
for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain
because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition
parties protesting plans for a new sales tax.
    If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably
have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on
the governments 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.
    Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the
trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner.
    But, he added, "If the issue of rice is to be raised...I
would mention the feelings of the Japanese people."
    Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country
cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because
the issue is too sensitive.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PETER TORDAY, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. is urging reluctant
commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel
Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes
the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
strategy, a Reagan administration official said.
    The officials comments also suggest that debtors pleas
for interest rate concessions should be treated much more
seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing
nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.
    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to
reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would
be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such
a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the
same time, however, the official expressed reservations that
such a scheme would ever get off the ground.
    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine
suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome
role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,
the official said in an interview with Reuters.
    "All of these things would fit within the definition of our
initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and
unique approach such as those should be considered," said the
official, who asked not to be named.
    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy
under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF
were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.
    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact
economic reforms promoting inflationfree economic growth.
    "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors
have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted
that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an
exception.
    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.
Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,
also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve
their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.
    "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications
to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more
effectively," the official said.
    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that
commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World
debt paper for socalled "exit bonds" for banks like regional
American or European institutions.
    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to
lend money to their former debtors every time a new money
package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in
its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.
    He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration
plan but "something some people have suggested."
    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are
examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would
differ slightly from the one the official described.
    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan
would work in the United States.
    "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
fine. I dont think they ever will."
    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World
loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant
to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.
    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no
more than 5/8 pct above Libor.
    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, its quite
unique and I dont think its something that should be
categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.
    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be
offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin
above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment
Notes.
    These tradeable, dollardenominated notes would have a
sixyear life and if banks swapped them for cash before
maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point
over Libor.
    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too
low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at
stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled
debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support
in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last
year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate
capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the
banks. "Its no more interest rate capitalisation than if you
have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed
before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to
be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue
that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness... What it really
is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.
    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an
initiative to include plans like the Philippines.

<TITLE>POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Stern, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Interest in the currency futures market
has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially
explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental
and Japanese currencies, analysts said.
    The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past
weekandahalf to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the
dollar on Monday, has spawned a newfound speculative boom.
    "Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and
technically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebber
analyst Jason Gillard said.
    "Weve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and
were going to stay with that, theres no reason to change,"
Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.
    Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark
futures positions, although some of those crosstrades were
liquidated yesterday, Sloane said.
     The fundamental keys to the pounds rise have been
relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism
surrounding the British economy, analysts said.
    "Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of Bear
Stearns, said of the 101/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.
    Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the
pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to
relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down
interest rates after the nations budget is released March 17.
    The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how
well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates
and oil income remain the main influences on the currency.
    However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.
interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut
their discount rates, and extend the pounds rally, Sloane
said.
    The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but
Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.
    The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with
smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" on
price charts, technicallyoriented analysts said.
    "It makes for an explosive type of situation that often
leads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said.
    Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian
dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent
close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.
    "At this stage of the game Id call the market longterm
positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a
close above the previous contract high of 75.25," Byers said.
    As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability
was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.
    Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and
June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,
respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.
    Yesterdays rebound showed the market was still very
respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank
intervention by the G5 nations plus Canada.
    "We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byers
said, "but people are very reluctant because they dont know
where the central banks will be to intervene."
    Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price
consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly
sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at
that level.

    The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund outstanding
shortterm borrowings, Storehouse Plc corporate treasurer Lance
Moir told Reuters.
    The issue was also designed to increase the international

consequently aimed primarily at continental investors who have
shown a high degree of interest in the issue, he added.
    Demand came mainly from West Germany and Switzerland.

<TITLE>DELORS REPORTS STRONG OBJECTIONS TO EC CASH PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>European Community
Commission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong
objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan
for changes to Community financing.
    In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC
leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow
additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves
pruning their own spending.
    Others called for major spending cut in the ECs
controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional
and social development.
    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors
plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a
second twoyear term.
    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the
EC should be based on their gross national product instead of
on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this
would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of
sharing the financial burden.
    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about
increased payments, he had told some heads of government the
Community needs more money.
    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to
reform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for over
two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to ask
for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those
farmers."
    He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government 
Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when
you are asking for a common market in goods and services"
    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine
internal market in industrial products and services.
    Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing
group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes.

foreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989,
the Jamaican Information Service said.
    Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years
with 81/2 years grace at 11/4 percentage points over the
London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously
restructured debt also will be cut to 11/4 point from 21/2.
    The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year.
    Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaican
delegation, called the terms very favourable to his country.
    The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee
led by the Bank of Nova Scotia ltBNO.TO> comes five days after
Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling
accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations.
    That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund
IMFs approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights
standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the
compensatory financing facility.
    Of Jamaicas foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pct
is owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed the
governments policy of not seeking new bank loans.

<TITLE>VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDMONTON, Alberta, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Lower production of coconut
and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks
this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.
    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta
Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world
vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.
    "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside
potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented
decline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.
    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm
kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln
tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.
    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at
33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance
at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.
    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,
disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by
600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.
    "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the
crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in
the edible oils sector could develop," he said.
    "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high
oil yielding seeds," Balletto said.
    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices
because of burdensome supplies, he said.
    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase
for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,
compared with 25.4 mln last year.
    The increase should result from lower disappearance, as
production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7
mln last year, he said.
    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln
tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,
while production of other oilseeds was lower.
    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made
up for lower production in the United States, he said.
    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.
stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.
    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,
about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.
    Since 198384, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased
13.1 mln tonnes.
    "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1
mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world
surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially
high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."
    "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds
prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long
as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.
    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a
range tied to the U.S. loan program.
    "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply
overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the
U.S. loan rate."
    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially
high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and
Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

<TITLE>BRAZILS GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils central bank governor
Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the countrys
unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.
    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of
Brazils bank advisory committee, and of coheads Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.
    High on the agenda will be banks complaints about Brazils
accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of shortterm trade
and interbank lines, the bankers said.
    Brazils several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as
part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled
with Brazils freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal
questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.
    They said they face problems because of the freeze
requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
their credit lines from one borrower to another.
    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
interestrate spreads, because foreign banks would rather
accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
central bank.
    "Its caused a lot of illwill with the banking community,"
one banker said.
    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
a 10day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for
Brazils debt stance.

<TITLE>CHINA WELCOMES U.S. COURT BOND DECISION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     PEKING, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>China welcomed a U.S. Supreme Court
decision dismissing claims by holders of 41 mln dlrs of
pre1949 Chinese bonds, but U.S. Officials said Peking has a
long way to go before it can issue bonds in the U.S.
     A Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news briefing that
China welcomed a Monday court ruling, which rejected a petition
by holders of railway bonds issued in 1911 by the ruling Qing
dynasty, which the Communist government does not acknowledge.
     The spokesman said the ruling "indicates the ... Railway
bearer bonds case is finally closed."
    But a U.S. Embassy official said that two other bond cases
were still in litigation and it was not known if the other
courts involved would accept the Supreme Court ruling.
    China has issued much of its recent overseas debt in Japan,
and has been badly hit by the yens sharp rise. A Western
banker said the U.S. Market has become more attractive to
China, since it is likely to issue bonds denominated in
currencies other than yen, and so protect itself against future
currency fluctuations.
    But a Western diplomat warned that potential U.S. Buyers
would not give China the warm reception it received in Japan.
    "U.S. Investors are not interested in China per se, as many
Japanese are. China has no track record in the U.S. Bond
market. Investors may demand disclosure of information Chinese
institutions are unwilling to give," he said.
    He said potential buyers might scrutinise Chinas human
rights record. Some institutions are reportedly concerned about
recent events in China, including a drive by the Chinese media
against "bourgeois liberalism."
    An official of stateowned China International Trust and
Investment Corp, which has raised funds in Hong Kong, Tokyo and
Frankfurt, declined comment on the court decision.

<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
announced a major shakeup in the ranks of his key advisers 
after weeks of continuing criticism of his government.
     Mulroney announced the departure of his senior policy
advisor, the resignation of his press secretary and the
reassignment of his communications director.
     Mulroneys Progressive Conservative government, shaken by
a series of cabinet resignations and allegations of corruption,
has been trailing the opposition parties for months in public
opinion polls.
     The prime minister, who led the Conservatives to a
landslide victory in the 1984 general election, had been urged
by party loyalists to make major changes within his office.
     A cabinet shuffle is expected later this month in advance
of more personnel changes within Mulroneys office as the prime
minister seeks to regain public confidence.
     The next election is expected sometime in 1988, although
it could be delayed until mid1989.

<TITLE>HONG KONG RAISES EXCHANGE FUND BORROWING LIMIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The borrowing limit of the Hong Kong
Exchange Fund, set up to regulate the value of the Hong Kong
dollar, has been raised to 50 billion H.K. Dlrs from 30 billion
by the legislature, an official statement said.
    The limit governs total borrowing by the fund from the
governments general revenue account and various funds as well
as borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations.
    The bulk of the governments fiscal surplus is invested by
the Treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by the
fund of interestbearing debt certificates, Financial Secretary
Piers Jacobs said.
    "At the close of the business today, the total amount of
debt certificates issued by the Exchange Fund in return for
money transferred from the general revenue account and the
various funds, in other words the total borrowing by the
Exchange Fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs,"
Jacobs said.
    He said borrowing arising from money market operations
would amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a total
of 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30
billion dlrs.
    Jacobs said the governments fiscal reserves are expected
to total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal year
ending March 31.
    "The current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will,
therefore, constrain the ability of the Exchange Fund to
continue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue of
interestbearing debt certificates," he said.
    "It will also constrain the ability of the exchange fund in
its money market operations," he added.

<TITLE>OFFICIAL SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES SECURITIES TAX</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration is totally
opposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securities
transactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit,
an administration official said in an interview.
    "Were totally opposed to a securities transfers tax. It
would impair the efficiency of some of the most efficient
markets in the world," he said. He declined to be named.
    In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat,
has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs he
estimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.
    "It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthy
individuals but on middle income people who occasionally invest
and trade. So I think its a very bad idea," said the official,
who is an administration economic policymaker.
    The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that the
administration delay next years cut in top tax rates, called
for in the recentlypassed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.
    "It is breaking faith with the American people ... It would
be a real breach of faith," he said.
    The GrammRudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budget
by 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court.
    Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass President
Reagans budget proposals for the fiscal year starting this
October, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108
billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under the
GrammRudman law.
    The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrs
in the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts and
revenue increases will achieve the GrammRudman goal.
    The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, also
said President Reagan was still opposed to a socalled budget
summit with Congress to resolve the deficit issue.
    The suggestion of a budget summit emerged again recently
after Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed a
deficit reduction package and an arms control accord with
Moscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal.
    But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as an
attempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accused
them of being overly critical before they had written their own
budget proposal, due out on April 1.
    "Its easier to write a book review than it is to write a
book. Weve written a book and the Democrats are writing a book
review every day. Lets see their book," he said.

put back the date at which it will move to its new premises in

<TITLE>SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW GAINS IN U.S. TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>There is little chance Soviet exports
to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscows current
trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods
in future, a Soviet economist said.
    Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an
agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a
U.S.USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items
that western nations want.
    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and
allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage
modest export gains in future.
    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of
goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion
dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.
    But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total
trade between the two countries would remain between two and
three billion dlrs a year.
    "The postdetente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit
its trading with the U.S.," he said.

<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Sight deposits of commercial banks at
the Swiss National Bank fell 2.88 billion Swiss francs in the
first 10 days of March to 7.65 billion, the National Bank said.
    Foreign exchange reserves rose 3.30 billion francs to 33.94
billion.
    Sight deposits are a major indicator of money market
liquidity in Switzerland.
    The National Bank said banks paid back 5.5 billion francs
of central bank credit taken out at the end of February for the
endmonth liquidity requirement.
    This drain was offset in part by new currency swaps, which
had the effect of increasing the National Banks foreign
exchange holdings.
    Bank notes in circulation fell 309.1 mln francs to 24.49
billion, and other deposits on call  basically government
funds  rose 1.06 billion to 2.10 billion.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Commercial banks are expected to
receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate
securities subsidiaries in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.
    A senior official at one of four prospective banks said the
ministry told his bank it would give approval as long as the
parent firm holds no more than 50 pct of the capital.
    "We expect the ministry to give us permission by the end of
April," he said.
    ltJ.P. Morgan and Co>, Bankers Trust New York Corp ltBT.N>,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp ltMHC.N> and Chemical New York Corp
ltFNBF.N> have asked for securities business licenses.
    Ministry officials declined to say when they would give
formal approval, but said they were working on the issue.
    Approval would pave the way for U.S. Commercial banks to
underwrite and trade equities in Japan under their own names.
    Citicorp ltCCI.N> and Chase Manhattan Corp ltCMB.N> have
already entered the Japanese securities market by acquiring
U.K. Securities houses already operating in Japan. Citicorp
took over ltVickers de Costa Ltd> and Chase bought ltLaurie
Milbank and Co>.
    Bankers did not know if all the banks would get licenses,
but said J.P. Morgan probably would as it was first to ask.

<TITLE>ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week"s
earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months,
energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.
    Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude
from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would
be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc ltTX.N> and a Mexican
and an Argentine firm.
    President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that
Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports
for four months due to the quake.
    Oil traditionally accounts for up to twothirds of
Ecuadors total exports and as much as 60 pct of government
revenues.
    Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador
would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to
meet its needs until the line was repaired.
    The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio
Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five
mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a
180day period.
    He added the Caracasbased Andean Development Corp had
granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,
50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.
    In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday
summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued
appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries,
the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.

<TITLE>IMF WARNS ISRAEL PAY RISES MAY THREATEN STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TEL AVIV, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund has
warned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wages
could undo the achievements of its economic stabilization
program in controlling hyperinflation.
    An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issued
an interim report praising Israels success in slashing
inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without
triggering mass unemployment.
    But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of the
perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on
stabilization programs.
    "Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress
in reducing inflation and the present level of employment," the
IMF said.
    The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel
Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that
higher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom were
rekindling inflation. "Though wage developments and the
reacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still time
to put the stabilization program back on track," it said.
    The warning comes ahead of Israels key public sector wage
negotiations next month.
    Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia BarShavit said real
growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall of
between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the
governments economic stabilisation programme was introduced.
    Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise to
around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be
necessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluation
against the dollar in January.
    BarShavit also said the government was implementing a
policy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancing
the budget.
    The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fast
last year and it supported the Bank of Israels raising of
interest rates in the last month.

<TITLE>CLARK HOLDS TALKS WITH SHULTZ IN WASHINGTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Foreign Secretary Joe Clark urged
the United States to take firm action on reducing "acid rain" and
on sticking with the strict interpretation of the
AntiBallistic Missile Treaty but said he won no promises.
    After a day of meetings with Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige, Clark told a press conference he was persuaded the
Reagan adminstration had begun to deal seriously with Canada
and its concerns.
    But he admitted he had won no assurances Washington would
go along with his governments position on several key
controversial issues.
    "Theres a lot more attention to Canadian files. What
remains to be seen is how much progress will be achieved," he
told reporters.
    The meetings, which end today with talks on Capitol Hill,
are part of a routine U.S.Canadian consultation but are also
expected to lay groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month
between President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Clark discouraged speculation that lack of a firm American
committment on the thorny issue of acid rain could render the
summit a failure.
    Canada is seeking evidence that Reagan is prepared to live
up to a commitment made last year to implement in the United
States a fiveyear five billion dlr U.S. program to test
cleaner ways of burning coal.
    "We expect the U.S. government to honor its commitment" and
discussed this with Shultz today, Clark said.
    "Theres no question the matter is under serious detailed
consideration at the highest levels of the U.S. government," he
said, adding that Shultz "left my meeting today to attend a
White House cabinet meeting that was discussing this as well
as other questions."
    "We will wait and see the results of that examination," he
said.
    Clark also said he reiterated Canadas position that the
United States should adhere to a strict interpretation of the
1972 ABM treaty, the only remaining operative arms control
agreement.

<TITLE>U.S. BANKS, THRIFTS FACE CHANGE FROM SENATE BILL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Barry</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. banks and savings and loan
institutions could face important changes as a result of
emergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate
Banking Committee.
    The bill approved 126 yesterday would rescue the
underfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts and
temporarily halt new developments in the provision of financial
services.
    The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse a
badly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors.
    It also limits banks ability to sell securities and
restricts a new breed of competitor, the socalled nonbank
banks.
    Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bills sponsor,
promised the committee will work on a longterm plan for new
developments in the financial services industry, which is
confronted by growing competition from firms in other
commercial centers, such as London and Tokyo.
    "This bill we are taking up today is the first step in this
effort," the Wisconsin Democrat said.
    But Sen. Jake Garn, the committees top Republican,
chastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions on
financial providers.
    "It is time to forget the special interests," the Utah
senator said.
    Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that would
have eliminated virtually all of the bills provisions except
the rescue for FSLIC.
    A major controversy focused on nonbank banks, which offer
limited financial services of a bank and avoid most banking
regulations.
    Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permit
new nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passes
comprehensive bank reform, a move welcomed by the bank
industry.
    But at the same time, the bill set a moratorium on a number
of new activities that banks may undertake, including selling
insurance, securities and real estate for one year after the
bill becomes law.
    The 7.5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented a
compromise between a larger amount sought by the Reagan
administration and a smaller figure proposed by the thrift
industry.
    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an industry group,
feared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to a
surge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors.
    "We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number,"
William OConnell, president of the league, said after the
committee voted.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Bernice Napach, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The oil services industry is on the
verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
industry analysts said.
    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
first half, and continue into the next decade.
     "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd ltSLB>,
Halliburton Co ltHAL>, Dresser Industries ltDI>, Baker
International ltBKO>, and McDermott International Inc ltMDR>,
which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
Dallasbased investor.
    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
oil services will begin in the U.S.
    "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
ltHT> figures show.
    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The
first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
second half of 1988," Kerridge said.
    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
pattern, Kerridge said.
    "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman,
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
stock market value, is diversifed in nonoil field businesess,
and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
flow including debt.
    Schlumberger is Freedmans second favorite oil service
stock.
    "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
technical leader in the industry," Freedman said.
    "Schlumbergers management shift, asset restructuring,
including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"
according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
billion dlrs.
    Bernsteins Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
pure service company, Sweeney said.
    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

<TITLE>CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>CreditanstaltBankverein ltCABV.VI> is
likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12
pct of share capital, deputy generaldirector Guido
SchmidtChiari said.
    The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous
year and SchmidtChiari noted that the parent banks share
capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986
from 2.7 billion a year earlier.
    SchmidtChiari made the forecast at a news conference when
the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.
    SchmidtChiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.
    The banking groups consolidated balance sheet total rose
to 453.4 billion schillings at yearend from 425.4 billion.
    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last
years better profits had resulted from improvements in
services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
lending.
    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
compared with those in other countries, he said.
    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,
Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.
    SchmidtChiari said that foreign lending business had
fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,
removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
total.
    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,
representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong
Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to
abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
drawing dividends.
    Preference shares of statecontrolled Creditanstalt rose
eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers
said improved results had been widely expected by investors.
    Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in
1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of
2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austrias
largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 mediumsized and
large Austrian companies.
    But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr
DaimlerPuch AG ltSDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar
to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.

<TITLE>SHANGHAI PLANS SOFT LOANS TO FINANCE MAIN PROJECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SHANGHAI, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Shanghai plans to rely on soft loans
to finance a number of largescale projects in the city
including an underground railway system, Mayor Jiang Zemin
said.
    Jiang told Reuters general manager Michael Nelson that he
hoped work on the railway system to ease Shanghais transport
problems would start within two years.
    Other projects in this city of 12 mln people include a
bridge and an extra tunnel under the Huangpu river, a new
airport and passenger ship terminals and Chinas biggest
railway station, due to open at the end of this year.
    The mayor said foreign companies would be invited to
participate in some projects through international tendering.
    But he added that firms hoping to take part would have to
come up with package deals involving soft loan financing.
    "This is a complex issue. The conditions relating to
tendering will have to be associated with conditions for
receiving soft loans," he said.
    He said the city was willing to use commercial loans to
finance technological improvements to factories which could
show a quick return in increased exports and foreign exchange
earnings.
    "But infrastructure projects take much longer and involve
much bigger investments, and with them, the ideal way is to use
soft loans," he said.
    The mayor added that British, French and Japanese firms had
already contacted the Shanghai authorities with proposals on
the underground railway project.
    Western business sources in Shanghai said the project,
involving the construction of 14 km of tunnelled track, had
been discussed for over 20 years, adding it was expected to
cost at least 750 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Jukwey, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to
fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an
overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day bpd to
defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.
    He told a news conference here "After due consultation with
my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria
and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold
the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various
quotas and official selling prices."
    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.
    "We are in a position to reconfirm that, despite misleading
news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member
countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the
month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.
    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at
900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm
determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs
agreed upon last December in Geneva.
    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for
OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
than the agreed level.
    "The idea was to suggest that OPECs agreement would not
hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman
said.
    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
on the verified figure for 10 out of OPECs 13 members, adding
that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
bpd.
    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
    "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
of 18 dlrs," the groups president said.
    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
    "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
December are being adhered to," he said.
    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes  fixed in
relation to the 18 dlr benchmark  Lukman replied "We consider
the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."
    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
below this time last year and soon they would return to the
market in search of crude.
    "We dont see that there is going to be any difficulty in
maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"
Lukman said.
    The OPEC president praised nonOPEC oil producers, which he
said had contributed to the groups efforts to stabilise
prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its longheld
view not to do anything to help the market.
    "We are quite confident, however, that in the longterm with
twothirds of the worlds reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.
    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuadors output
following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
when it recovered from the disaster.

<TITLE>ST. JOE GOLD ltSJG> TO DEVELOP MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLAYTON, Mo., March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to
proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property
in northwestern Ontario.
    It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue
underground development and obtain operating permits and
another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete
underground development, construct a mill and provide the
infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial
production.
    St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were
granted in time, it would start gold production in the second
half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of
about 40,000 troy ounces.
    The company said the property is estimated to contain over
500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project
covers only seven of 192 claims, with drillindicated reserves
of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.
    It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150
tons of ore daily.
    St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been
tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and
exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and
the adjacent whollyowned Muskeg Lake property.
    The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver
deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has
been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading
0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.
 It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility
study is nearing completion.

Executive Commission did not have the power to launch the

    The plan was aimed at offloading 200,000 tonnes of butter

<TITLE>JAPAN TO CURB VEHICLE EXPORTS TO EC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese car makers will curb their
exports to the European Community EC following an unofficial
directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
MITI, automobile industry sources said.
    Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to
be at most unchanged from last years 1.10 mln units and may
even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic
growth and increasing trade friction.
    Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairs
Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to
exercise prudence in exporting to Europe.

<TITLE>HUGHES TOOL ltHT> BOARD APPROVES MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Hughes Tool Co said its board voted at
a special meeting last night to approve a new agreement with
regulators that would allow the company to complete its
proposed merger with Baker International Corp ltBKO>.
    The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice
yesterday, will give the merged company, Baker Hughes, six
months instead of three to sell certain assets.
    The pact also allows a threemonth extension, if warranted,
and limits the obligation of the new company to give financial
support to the businesses to be divested, pending their sale.
    The company said its board recommended that shareholders
approve the merger of the oilfield service companies. A
previously adjourned meeting of Hughes Tool stockholders will
be resumed this afternoon, it said.
    "Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department
towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and
filing it as soon as possible," the company said in a
statement. Closing of the merger would occur immediately after
the filing, it said.
    The assets to be sold under the consent decree consist of
Bakers domestic oilfield drilling bit business and its
domestic submersible electric pump business. Baker has an
agreement to sell the pump business to Trico Industries Inc
ltTRO>.
    The financial terms of the merger are unchanged, a Hughes
spokesman said. Under those terms, each Baker common share and
Hughes common share would be converted into one share and 8/10
of a share, respectively, of Baker Hughes Inc, which would be
formed as a new holding company.

<TITLE>AGENCY TO REVIEW JOHNSON AND JOHNSON SWEETENER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW BRUNSWICK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Johnson and Johnson said the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its food
additive petition for a highintensity sweetener has been
formally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.
    The company said the product, with the generic name of
sucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is
about 600 times sweeter.
    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.
    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly
developed with Tate and Lyle PLC ltTATL>.
    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United
Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.
The company noted its petition covering the product and its
safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.
    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is
proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil
Specialty Products Co subsidiary.
    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing
agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with
scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the
discovery of Sucralose in 1976.
    Patents and licensing agreements control the use of
sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.
    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.
The carbonchloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not
broken during digestion or metabolism.
    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The
chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.

<TITLE>SENATORS, PROSECUTOR DISAGREE ON IRAN TESTIMONY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Senators and a special prosecutor
were in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quick
answers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and the
diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.
    Senators on a special Senate committee investigating the
scandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution to
force early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and John
Poindexter.
    North is the National Security Council NSC aide President
Reagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iran
arms payments to the socalled contra rebels. Poindexter, who
was NSC director and Norths boss, resigned the same day. 
    The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexter
was ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the funds
diversion, contrary to Reagans denial that he knew of it.
    Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a special
House committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for North
and Poindexter for at least 90 days, and would make the same
request to the Senate committee today.
    Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delay
granting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.
    Walsh, whose job is to determine whether anyone should be
prosecuted for criminal misconduct, said premature immunity
could put the three beyond the law before a grand jury can
decide whether they should be prosecuted.

<TITLE>HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Lewis, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>National Bank of Hungary first
vicepresident Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct
devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last
years severe trade deficit with the West.
    Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at
least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.
    "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a
real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."
    The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would
devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be
announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into
effect tomorrow.
    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had
a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its
main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and
5.5 pct in 1986.
    This was partly an aftereffect of action Hungary took to
prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of
the 1970s, he added.
    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by
between three and four pct early last year.
    But the countrys hard currency trade balance nevertheless
fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3
mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.
    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade
surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a
more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total
hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.
    One Western commercial attache here said "Devaluation of
itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they
also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the
quality of their export goods."
    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this
year to invest in restructuring industry.
    It would be his role to persuade international banks to
cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an
AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai
bond market.
    Hungarys net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion
dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a
current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because
the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt
denominated in marks or yen.
    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this
year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of
modernisation.
    "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am
against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic
product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.
   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt
profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term
loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking
more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he
considered rates to be low.
    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at
around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which
tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after
quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was
working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for
this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion
forints.

<TITLE>ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuadors deputy energy minister
Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
further Venezuelan assistance to his countrys oil industry
following last weeks earthquake, officials said.
    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.
    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that
Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuadors entire OPEC quota,
set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.
    "All options are open at this moment in the context of
cooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and mines
ministry source said.
    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
pipeline is repaired, officials said.
    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines
minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at
technical level, officials said.
    Industry sources said that among the options are for
Venezuela to produce Ecuadors entire quota, or for Venezuela
and nonOPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply
Ecuadors Far Eastern clients.
    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been
reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made
in due course.
    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have
to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its
needs until the line was repaired.
    Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran
said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

<TITLE>OUTOKUMPU RESTRUCTURES COPPER DIVISION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Finlands mining and metals group
Outokumpu Oy ltOUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of
83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it
restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt
to rationalize production and improve profitability.
    Outokumpus Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a
news conference the reorganization involved a split of the
division into a new independent division with six profit
centres.
    Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and
taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It
had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.
    Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in
January 1986, ltMetallverken Ab> and ltWirsbo Bruks Ab>, that
were merged into its copper processing division.
    The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last
year, 42 pct of Outokumpus group turnover of 7.58 billion.
    The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products
Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpus copper production
plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries ltNippert Co> and
ltValleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo.
    Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent
division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbos
copper tube production into one of the new divisions profit
centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this
year.
    The new division will have production plants in Finland,
Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S.

<TITLE>U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. merchandise trade deficit
on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs
in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15
billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously
reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.
    For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a
record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,
the department said.
    During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78
billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports
rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.
    The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes
such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and
insurance.
    The Commerce Department said nonpetroleum imports in the
quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion
dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose
1.2 billion dlrs, and in nonmonetary gold and passenger cars
from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.
    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct
because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department
said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18
pct decrease in the number of South Koreanmade imported cars
and a nine pct decrease from Japan.
    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs
or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct
or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.
    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because
supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were
limited by drought.
    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America
rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700
mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200
mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.
    The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,
including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell
500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit
decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.
    In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or
nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3
billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.
    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6
billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower
prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs
from 26.41 dlrs.
    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct
to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell
27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and
soybeans nine pct.
    The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1
billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe
increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>SIGMA MINES DETAILS GOLD ORE RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>ltSigma Mines Quebec Ltd>, 65 pct
owned by Dome Mines Ltd ltDM>, said its Sigma Mine had proven
and probable reserves at the end of 1986 of 4,902,940 tons,
with an average grade of 0.139 ounces of gold a ton.
    Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future
production at current milling rates.
    The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves
grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161
tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of
gold a ton.
    Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method
following Dome Mines previously reported move to adopt general
industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore
reserves.
    Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven
reserves that could be mined without future development costs.
    Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons
grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to
about two years future production.

<TITLE>NOVO INDUSTRI EARNINGS FALL DESPITE INCREASED SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Danishbased insulin and enzymes
producer Novo Industri A/S NVO.CO said pretax earnings fell
almost 10 pct in 1986 though sales rose by two pct.
    The pretax figure fell to 788 mln crowns from 872 mln in
1985, on sales increased from 4.1 billion to 4.2 billion,
giving net earnings of 521 mln crowns against 604 mln in 1985.
    Earnings per 20crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45
crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend.
    "Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very
significant factor behind developments in the result before and
after tax," Novo said in a statement.
    "Not only the U.S. Dollar but also other currencies
essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown,"
the statement added.
    In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S
Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and
development of CNS central nervous treatment treatments and
the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.
    The 357 mln crowns paid in goodwill "had a very limited
effect on the 1986 result," the Novo statement said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Thai sugar production totalled 960,788
tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986,
according to figures received by the International Sugar
Organization.
    November and December production figures also exceeded last
years totals with the result that output in the first three
months of the season showed a 23.1 pct increase over 1985/86.
Production in the November 1986 to January 1987 period totalled
1.29 mln tonnes.
    Thai exports in December and January were down, however.
January exports fell from 73,164 to 35,910 tonnes.
    Domestic consumption increased 7.3 pct to 192,069 tonnes
for the three month period, but this was not sufficient to
prevent a significant rise in stocks, which climbed to 1.62 mln
tonnes by the end of January, compared with 1.52 mln a year
earlier.
    Thai Agricultural Ministry officials have previously
forecast a decline in 1986/87 raws output to around 2.3 mln
tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER ltC> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corps 1.5 billion dlr bid to
takeover American Motors Corp ltAMO> should help bolster the
small automakers sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
    It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motors
headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
Chrysler and AMCs French parent Renault, according to company
spokesman Edd Snyder.
    But AMCs future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
it had continued with the staterun French car group as its
controlling shareholder.
    Industry analysts said the future of AMCs car assembly
plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
    Both plants are far from "state of the art" for car
manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
relations at each.
    "Chrysler doesnt need that many new plants," said Michael
Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
Lehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant and
move Jeep production to Canada."
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
local representing Jeep workers.
    "The UAW wont be able to hold them up for ransom as they
have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
underutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.
    Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
would abort a combination which historians said would be the
auto industrys biggest merger since American Motors was formed
in 1954.
    AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
earliest.
    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacocca cited AMCs Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
in the AMC buyout.

<TITLE>ST. JOE GOLD TO DEVELOP ONTARIO MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLAYTON, Mo., March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to
proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property
in northwestern Ontario.
    It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue
underground development and obtain operating permits and
another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete
underground development, construct a mill and provide the
infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial
production.
    St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were
granted in time, it would start gold production in the second
half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of
about 40,000 troy ounces.
    The company said the property is estimated to contain over
500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project
covers only seven of 192 claims, with drillindicated reserves
of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.
    It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150
tons of ore daily.
    St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been
tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and
exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and
the adjacent whollyowned Muskeg Lake property.
    The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver
deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has
been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading
0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.
 It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility
study is nearing completion.

<TITLE>BILFINGER UND BERGER SEES OUTPUT FALLING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANNHEIM, West Germany, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Bilfinger und BergerBau
AG ltGBFG.F> expects group construction output in 1987 to fall
to around 2.5 billion marks in 1987 from 2.73 billion last year
and sees foreign business stabilizing just under its 1986
level.
    In a letter to shareholders, Bilfinger und Berger said
foreign construction work fell to 1.37 billion marks in 1986
from 2.10 billion the year before. It said the drop was due to
a fall in orders and the dollars decline against the mark.
    The firm expects good 1986 results, with an appropriate
dividend. In 1985 group net profit fell to 14.1 mln marks from
22.6 mln in 1984 and the dividend lost one mark to nine marks.
    Bilfinger und Bergers U.S. Units took up 600 mln marks of
its total foreign construction output.
    The company said domestic earnings in 1986 improved
slightly despite strong competition, due to efforts to avoid
taking on orders which would not break even.
    Foreign earnings were hit by the lower dollar and temporary
payment difficulties by clients.
    Incoming orders in 1986 rose to 3.05 billion marks from
2.58 billion the year before, comprising domestic 1.30 billion
marks versus 1.41 billion and foreign 1.75 billion marks versus
1.18 billion.
    Foreign incoming orders rose despite economic difficulties
in developing countries and OPEC nations hit by lower oil
prices, Bilfinger und Berger said.
    In 1986 it won new orders in the U.S., Pakistan, Nigeria
and Egypt.
    Orders on hand at end1986 totalled 3.64 billion marks
against 3.32 billion at end1985.

<TITLE>LEUCADIA HAS 50 MLN DLR REVOLVING FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Leucadia National Corp, a U.S. Financial
services holding company, has received a 50 mln dlr, fiveyear
revolving underwriting facility RUF, said Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets as arranger.
    Under terms of the facility, Leucadia may issue euronotes
in maturities from one to six months, subject to a maximum of
183 days. The method of issuance will be the issuerset margin
system under which Leucadia will determine the spread over the
London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR.
    Leucadia has already established a eurocommercial paper
program for which Merrill acts as dealer.
    The RUF may serve as medium term backup to the commerical
paper program although the two may be used simultaneously,
Merrill said.
    In addition to issuing euronotes, Leucdia may also draw
under the RUF by use of a socalled "swing line," which provides
same day availability of funds of up to 25 mln dlrs. Also, the
swing line provides for use of a "spot issuance procedure which
allows the company to borrow up to the full amount of the 50
mln dlrs on two days notice.

    Bank of England officials were not immediately available

bank interest rates in a surprise move, which aimed at limiting
sterlings rise ahead of the March 17 budget.

<TITLE>NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
step down only after his plan to overhaul Japans tax system
gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said
today.
    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private
meeting, "Nakasones power in office does not necessarily
terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when
the seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."
    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite
Sundays unexpected Upper House byelection defeat of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP in a conservative
stronghold.
    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,
had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added
sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.
    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the
sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding
nothing but retraction of the tax.
    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the
1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax
plans. They have been resorting to an onoff boycott of
parliament since February 4.
   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular
parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice
summit of industrial democracies in June and open an
extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.
    Under law, a regular session can be extended only once
while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other
option would be to extend the current session, he said.
    "The opposition parties will surely present a noconfidence
motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."
    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up
the way for tax reform.
   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet
en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House
for a snap general election," the aide said.
    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign
from the 512seat Lower House, necessitating byelections.
    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its
landslide victory in general elections last July.
    There are five independents and three vacancies.
    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate
their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," the
aide said.
    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little
effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.
    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the
nations 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.
    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all
oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.
    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial
elections in Japans northernmost island of Hokkaido and
Fukuoka in southern Japan," he said.
    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

<TITLE>NYNEX ltNYN> URGES JUSTICE DEPT. PLAN APPROVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>NYNEX Corp will urge the U.S.
District Court to approve Justice Department recommendations
easing restrictions on offering new services by regional
telephone firms, chairman Delbert Staley said.
    "While NYNEX would have prefered the unqualified lifting of
all of the Modified Final Judgement restrictions, we intend to
urge Judge Harold Greene to act as quickly as possible to
approve the recommendations," Staley told a news conference.
    NYNEX will file its comments with the U.S. District Court
on Friday, he said.
    Staley referred to Justice Department recommendations to
Greene last month that restrictions on manufacturing,
information services and outofregion, longdistance service
be eliminated.
    Referring to information services, Staley said, "That
certainly is one area we would quickly move into."
    Electronic mail, voice mail and videotext are some of the
services NYNEX could offer, he added.
    NYNEX disagreed with the departments recommendation to
retain restrictions on longdistance service within a local
service region, Staley said.
    The company would like to have the option of providing
longdistance service within and outside its region, he said.
    "Our entry in longdistance would further stimulate
competition," Staley said.
    "We believe it would put downward pressure on consumer
costs."

<TITLE>MERRILL LYNCH U.K. EXECUTIVE CHARGED BY SEC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange Commission
said it charged a managing director of
ltMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Ltd> in London with
masterminding "a massive insider trading scheme."
    Nahum Vaskevitch, the managing director of the Mergers and
Aquisitions Department of the brokers London office, was
charged in a civil complaint by the SEC filed in Manhattan
Federal Court. The complaint said Vaskevitch leaked information
about 12 companies that were involved in a merger or aquisition
which resulted in more than four mln dlrs in profit for himself
and others involved in the scheme.
    Besides Vaskevitch, who is a British and Israeli citizen
who lives in London, others named as defendants in the suit
were David Sofer, an Israeli citizen living in Jerusalem, and
two corporations, ltPlenmeer Ltd>, a British company, and ltMeda
Establishment>, a Lichtenstein corporation.
    The scheme, which covered a two year period, allegedly
involved Vaskevitch leaking information to Sofar about looming
takeovers and mergers, some of which he worked on, according to
the complaint. The SEC secured a temporary restraining order
freezing all the assets of the defendants in the United States.
A hearing is set for March 20.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith is a subsidiary of
Merrill Lynch and Co Inc ltMER>.
    According to the court documents, Sofer is a principal in
both Plenmeer and Meda Establishment and Vaskevitch has an
interest in Plenmeer.
    The suit was filed in New York because trading allegedly
took place here. 
    One of the deals in which an insider profit was alleged was
the 1984 merger of KMart Corp ltKM> with ltPay Less Drug
Stores>.
    Another deal was the sale by W.R. Grace and Co ltGRA> of its
holdings in ltHermanns Sporting Goods Co>.
    An SEC official in Washington said the Vaskevitch case is
unrelated to the agencys widening investigation into Wall
Streets insider trading scandal involving Ivan Boesky and
Dennis Levine.
    Neither Vaskevitch nor Sofar are currently living in the
United States and cannot be extradited on the basis of the
SECs civil charges filed against them, the official said.
    Vaskevitch is living in England and Sofars whereabouts are
unknown, he said.
    "We cant force them to come back," the official said.
    The agency is moving to seize all U.S. assets of both men,
which they could forfeit if they do not contest the case, the
SEC official said.
    Although the SEC recently signed an accord with Britain
aimed at improving cooperation between the two countries in
investigating securities law violations, the SEC official said
it did not need to rely on U.K. authorities in this case.
    "We were able to make our case against them here," he said.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The engineers union IG Metall said
35,700 workers at 152 West German engineering companies held
brief warning strikes today in support of the unions demands
for higher wages and shorter working hours without loss of pay.
    It said most of the stoppages were in northern Germany,
where employers and union representatives met for talks on a
collective wage agreement for 300,000 engineering workers in
the Hamburg, SchleswigHolstein and Lower Saxony areas.
    IG Metall members began a series of nationwide warning
strikes this week as part of the unions bid to raise wages by
five pct and cut the working week to 35 hours from 38.5 hours.
    Warning strikes held so far this week have generally lasted
about one hour each.
    Employers in northern German offered IG Metall a 2.7 pct
rise in wages from April 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July next
year. It also offered to cut the working week by half an hour
from July 1988.
    IG Metall rejected the offer, and further talks for
northern Germany were later scheduled for March 23.

offered workers there a similar package of wage rises and
shorter working hours.

<TITLE>JC PENNEY ltJCP> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 11  </DATELINE><BODY>J.C. Penney Cos stock rose sharply 
after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the
stock, based on the companys strong earnings momentum and the
possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,
traders said.
    "I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,"
analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its
buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a
time that they needed to."
    The stock jumped 21/2 to 983/4.
    Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the
year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback,
or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.
    In addition, he said the company has been gradually
adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been
improving.
    Smith expects the company to earn 8.25to8.50 dlrs a share
in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.
Last years results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of
debt.

about 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into
intervention so far.
    A spokesman, speaking from Frankfurt, told Reuters offers
have increased recently but contracts have not yet been
concluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier
confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to
intervention boards in various member states. The intervention
board spokesman in Frankfurt said, "One million tonnes is an
awful lot and the Communitys coffers are almost empty. This
could turn into a serious political problem."
    West German trade sources said they believed the one mln
tonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would
have a neutral market impact overall.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>ltSigma Mines Quebec Ltd>, 65 pct
owned by Dome Mines Ltd, said its Sigma Mine had proven and
probable reserves at the end of 1986 of 4,902,940 tons, with an
average grade of 0.139 ounces of gold a ton.
    Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future
production at current milling rates.
    The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves
grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161
tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of
gold a ton.
    Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method
following Dome Mines previously reported move to adopt general
industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore
reserves.
    Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven
reserves that could be mined without future development costs.
    Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons
grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to
about two years future production.

Commission for his extensive openmarket purchases of USAir
Group Inc ltU> stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.
    "This is a matter that is being looked into," Charles Rule,
acting assistant attorney generalantitrust, told the Senate
Judiciary Committees Antitrust Subcommittee.
    Rule declined further comment while the review was
continuing.
    Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum
DOhio, who had asked why the department was not acting
against "what appears to be a clear violation of the law."
    Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a premerger
notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15
mln dlrs worth of USAir stock.
    But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser
would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a
merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.
    Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the
filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.
    The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it
lacked the necessary data for the government to review the
proposed USAir takeover bid.
    Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday.
    Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation
were found.

<TITLE>MERRILL LYNCH ltMER> SUSPENDS U.K. MERGER CHIEF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch and Co ltMER> said the
head of its mergers and acquisitions department in London,
accused by U.S. authorities of insider trading violations, has
been suspended from the firm.
    If the charges are true "we are disappointed and angry,"
Merrill Lynch said in a statement. Merrill Lynch said it has
been cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation of the matter for several months. The SEC charged
Nahum Vaskevitch, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Ltd, with profiting from inside information
about 12 companies involved in mergers.
    "Merrill Lynchs position is and has always been that
violations of the law are not tolerated," the firm said in a
prepared statement.
    "The apparently illegal trading activity took place away
from Merrill Lynch through another brokerdealer and involved
the employees use of information which was properly available
to him but improperly used," the statement said. "Merrill Lynch
in no way benefited from the trades."
    Merrill Lynch said Vaskevitch was suspended "when we were
informed of the specific allegations and evidence." The company
did not say precisely when the suspension took place.

it downgraded ratings for longterm senior debt and

senior longterm debt rating fell to A plus high from A plus

<TITLE>DUPONT ltDD> UP ON RECOMMENDATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Du Pont Co rose today after
accumulating recommendations from Shearson Lehman Brothers and
First Boston, traders said.
    Du Pont, which opened with a two point gain, stood at
1091/8, up 11/8.
    First Bostons analyst was not available for comment.
    Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his
earnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987
and eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a
share in 1986.
    "Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a
strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar
and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to
aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first
quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude
prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings
of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.
    He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend
about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20
dlrs a share, "and a stock split is possible but it has a low
probablility."

<TITLE>PROGRESS AT RUBBER PACT TALKS REPORTED SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiators at a United Nations
conference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards
reaching an agreement, delegates said.
    The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as the
final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber
Agreement INRA before the current one expires in October.
    Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part
in the twoweek meeting. This is the fourth such conference in
nearly two years.
    Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key
issue of the price adjustment mechanism.
    Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals
instead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currently
rejected by producers.
    And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be
automatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the
International Rubber Organization Council in the price
adjustment procedure.
    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said it
was "imperative" to settle outstanding issues this week so that
technical drafting work can be done next week.

cogeneration venture as a "qualifying" facility under the

<TITLE>MITCHELL ENERGY ltMND> AGAIN CUTS CAPITAL OUTLAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Mitchell Energy and
Development Corp said it plans to hold its capital spending in
fiscal 1988, ending January 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the
123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986.
    The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this
year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due
to mild weather and soft economic conditions.
    "But the contracts call for the lower takes to be made up
during the course of the year," Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile
it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.
    Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend to
lower the average price realized for gas in the early part of
fiscal 1988.
    However, it said the average for the full year is not
expected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per
thousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.

<DATELINE>    BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>River Oaks Industries Inc said
it agreed in principle to give control of the company to Benson
Seizer, a New York investor, in return for 2.6 mln dlrs in
capital.
    The company, a maker of mobile homes, said it terminated
merger discussions with ltNursing Centers of America>.
    River Oaks said it will place a 2.6 mln dlr convertible
note with Seizer, who in turn will name six additional members
to the companys fivemember board. One of the new directors
will take over as chairman and chief executive officer, River
Oaks said.
    River Oaks said the note will be convertible into two mln
shares of its common stock at one dlr a share. The company
currently has 14 mln shares outstanding.
    The company said it will also grant Seizer an option to buy
an additional 2.6 mln shares during the next four years at 1.25
dlrs a share during the first year and 1.50 dlrs a share
thereafter.
    The company said the money raised from Seizer will further
strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its ability to seek
selective expansion opportunities.
    Seizer is experienced in turnaround situations and is
expected to take direct involvement in River Oaks management,
said Charles F. DeGroot, who will remain a director of the
company after giving up the post of chairman to one of Seizers
board nominees.
    Don Manning will cede his post as chief executive but will
remain president, the company said.

<TITLE>NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Interest rates look set to move
lower even after Mondays halfpoint cut in bank base rates to
101/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
a British National Savings issue yesterday.
    The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
in October and paying a high taxfree 83/4 pct on fiveyear
private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
market.
    The move was followed by a surprise sellout within minutes
today of a Bank of England onebillion stg tap issue, the
second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
    They said the nearinstant sale of the entire new gilts
issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
had to drop sooner rather than later.
    The sale of the tranche of 83/4 pct treasury bonds due
1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
bellwether threemonth interbank rate down 1/8 point at
1097/8 pct.
     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
pushed the pound to fouryear highs against the dollar.
    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said
Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
Phillips and Drew "It is an indication that the market believes
rates are going to fall further ... At least by a halfpoint
immediately after the budget on March 17, and some people
hope for more."
    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was "of considerable significance."
    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being
quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."
    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
reduction in mortgage lending rates.
    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
    "National Savings has been competing too effectively with
the building societies of late. Building society income has
been depressed in recent months," he said.
    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
on U.K. Inflation.
    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
last years 3.7 pct.
    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
prices, Lewis said a onepoint cut in building society rates
would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts.
    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies criticism to heart. It looks like the
National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.
    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
the rest of the market.
    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
becoming too expensive and we dont need all that money," he
told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at
least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above
or below market rates.
    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and
income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.
    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Savings
contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,
compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the
previous year, official figures show.
    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the
total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

<TITLE>FMHA COULD LOSE SEVEN BILLION DLRS IN LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Farmers Home Administration, the
U.S. Agriculture Departments farm lending arm, could lose
about seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on its
severely delinquent borrowers, or about onefourth of its farm
loan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture
Committee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,
also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes in
FmHAs financial eligibility standards indicated as many as one
half of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agency
in 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.
    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants credit using
a variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely on
cashflow ability.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy DVt.
slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHA
Administrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a
"dramatic shift" in the agencys purpose away from being farmers
lender of last resort toward becoming a "big city bank."
    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agency
had a responsibility to administer its 70billion dlr loan
portfolio in a "compassionate yet judicious manner."
    Crowley of GAO, Congress investigative arm, said the
proposed credit scoring system attempted to ensure that FmHA
would make loans only to borrowers who had a reasonable change
of repaying their debt.

<TITLE>EC CONCERNED OVER U.S. TEXTILE IMPORT MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community EC expressed
disquiet over protectionist moves in the United States to limit
imports of textiles and said it would retaliate immediately if
EC exports were hit.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said EC External Trade
Commissioner Willy De Clercq had written to his U.S.
Counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
outlining the concerns of the 12nation Community.
    The draft legislation under consideration by Congress would
impose permanent quotas on products entering the U.S. and seek

<TITLE>BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Budget Minister Guy
Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several
stateowned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and
the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources
said.
    They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs
in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadts
projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget
deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.
    But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the
Social Christian parties in Belgiums centreright coalition
when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.
    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,
the sources said.
    Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last
quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state
investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three
billion francs, they added.
    A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid1989 for 1.5
billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and
telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in
mid1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.
    Also on Verhofstadts list are the Maritime Transport
Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings
bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.
    Le Soir daily quoted CGER vicepresident Paul Henrion as
expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.
    "Public company we are and public company we wish to stay,"
Henrion told the paper.

<TITLE>LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RATZEBURG, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The overall area devoted to sugar
beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22
mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German
statistician F.O. Licht said.
    It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices
would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,
Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was
probably minimal.
    The total beet area in the European Community is forecast
to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.
    The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,
against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at
4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.
    Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares
with 1986 figures in brackets, are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114
118, Denmark 69 69, France 419 421, Greece 35 44,
Ireland 36 38, Italy 270 275, Netherlands 129 138,
Portugal 1 1, Spain 192 190, U.K. 200 201, West Germany
385 399, Austria 32 28, Finland 30 31, Sweden 51 52,
Switzerland 15 14, Turkey 355 340, Yugoslavia 160 136.
    Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400
3440, Albania 10 9, Bulgaria 52 50, Czechoslovakia 195
196, East Germany 210 205, Hungary 108 96, Poland 460
440, Romania 295 280.
    On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these
area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in
1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln
tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high
last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases
the chances of a significant reduction in production in
1987/88.
    Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could
fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln
in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9
mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be
12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87.

<TITLE>MEESE SEES A PLUS IN CHRYSLERAMC MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Attorney General Edwin Meese said he
saw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co
ltAMO> By Chrysler Corp ltC> in that it would return the smallest
of the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.
    Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that
consideration would be part of the Justice Departments review
of the proposed merger. He said the agency has not yet received
a formal notice of the merger which would start the review
process.
   Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from its
French parent Renault.
    "I think one of the things that has to be recognized in that
merger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of the
ownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas hands
will be put back in American hands," Meese told the
subcommittee.
    "That may be one of the factors that would be weighed in the
judgment," he added.
    Renault currently holds about 46 pct of AMC.

<TITLE>SOSNOFF SAYS CAESARS ltCAW> OFFERED STOCK BUYBACK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Martin Sosnoff, who has offered to
buy Caesars World Inc for 28 dlrs a share, said senior
officials of the company have offered to buy back the Caesars
stake he already holds, now 13.6 pct of the total outstanding.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offers
to buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during the
past year."
    The offers were made by several Caesars World
representatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said. 
   Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals.
    The Caesars World official suggested various forms of
payment for Sosnoffs stake, including other securities of the
company and cash, he said. Sosnoff did not detail the value of
the proposed compensation.
    Also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" option
regarding Sosnoffs Caesars World holdings, he said.
    The proposed deals would have also included a "standstill"
agreement, which would have restricted Sosnoffs right to buy
more Caesars World stock or "to take any action adverse to
incumbent management," he said.
    Sosnoffs report on the offers he received for his Caesars
World shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the
company, as well as reported to the SEC.
    Sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln Caesars World shares, or
13.6 pct of the companys 30 mln shares outstanding.
    The Sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he does
not already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, wellheeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firms research.
    "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
were seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
Frenchowned Minatome Corp., a unit of ltTotal Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International ltTEICC>
and Lear Petroleum Partners ltLPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgianowned firms, ltPetrofina S.A.>
and ltCometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos ltWMB>,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japans
ltNippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Incs ltTX> Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Duponts ltDD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the payback period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple priceperbarrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houstonbased land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of ltPreussag
Corp> and ltC. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebbers Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because we
feel its substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
youre going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market," he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houstonbased Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
ltRD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."

<TITLE>AUSTRIAN 1987 GROWTH SEEN BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A meeting of leading politicians,
bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross
domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5
pct, a government spokesman said.
    This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the
semiofficial Institute for Economic Research WIFO last
December.
    Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,
told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting
attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina,
National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.
    Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently
mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this
year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states.
    Hannes Androsch, general director of
CreditanstaltBankverein ltCABV.VI>, today put 1987 GDP growth
at between one and 1.5 pct.
    Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment
for the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was
unlikely to be more than six pct.

<TITLE>EL PASO ELECTRIC ltELPA> REACHES NEW MEXICO PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EL PASO, Texas, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>El Paso Electric Co said it has
agreed to limit rate increases in its New Mexico service
territory to a maximum of nine pct over the next three years.
    Last year, about 18 pct of the utilitys revenues came from
New Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and
12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation.
    In January the company filed a formal rate case with New
Mexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annual
rates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrs
net of fuel savings.
    El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement on
its New Mexico rates with several parties, including the state
of the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides for
rate treatment of the utilitys investment in the Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz.
    The company said commission hearings on the stipulated
settlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved,
the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. El
Paso Electrics January rate case will remain before the
commission pending approval of the settlement.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continued
full inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unit
one, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents per
kilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rate
increases until 1994.
    Once the agreement is approved, the utility would still
have to prove cost of service increases to support at least the
maximum increase each year, a spokesman explained.
    The company said it will attempt to settle the cost of
service issues in timed to allow the new rates to go into
effect this summer.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in its
New Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with the
utilitys 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in Palo
Verde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold.
    The company said it agreed that none of its costs for Palo
Verde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates.
    The utility said the agreement also resolves any issue
relating to the prudence of the planning, management and
construction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue of
excess generating capacity through 1993.
    El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excess
generating capacity.
    The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost of
service deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 will
not be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said,
adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

<TITLE>CBT POSTPONES NIGHT TRADING START TO APRIL 30</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Board of Trades CBT
board of directors voted to postpone the start of what will be
the first U.S. evening futures trading session until April 30
from April 2 to give participants a chance to get ready, the
exchange announced.
    Several trading firms had asked for a delay in the startup
of the evening session so that the firms can work out
operational difficulties created by the offhours session.
    CBT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a statement the delay
will "afford all firms the time necessary to be 100 pct ready
for this innovative program, we are postponing the opening
date."
    The board of directors accepted yesterdays recommendation
by a committee of members overseeing the planned evening
session, which was originally scheduled to start April 2. The
session is designed to begin the global trading day from 1800
to 2100 local Chicago time Monday through Thursday.
    CBT members overwhelmingly approved the evening session in
a vote conducted a month ago.
    But before night trading can begin, the CBT still has to
obtain approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
    Pending regulatory approval, the CBT plans to offer evening
trading in the worlds most active futures contract, Treasury
bonds, along with Treasury note futures and options on those
contracts.
    The evening session will make available to traders in the
Far East interest rate hedging vehicles when their day is just
beginning, and the CBT hopes to attract trading capital from
the Pacific Rims burgeoning financial centers.
    When the idea for a night trading session was broached, it
met with resistance from many local traders who said the
session would add to the physical strain of their jobs.
    Many traders and member firms also questioned whether the
night session would have the liquidity necessary to survive,
and complained that the cost of manning trading desks for two
sessions per 24hour cycle might not be worthwhile.
    Some credit market analysts, including Norman Quinn,
president of Golden Gate Futures, said the night session would
likely be dominated by institutions, because the larger local
traders would refuse to return at night.
    Nevertheless, Quinn and other traders said the night
session has a good chance of succeeding.

<TITLE>FRENCH AEROSPACE INDUSTRY HAS MIXED 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The French aerospace industry had a mixed
year in 1986, with military sales hit by the falling dollar and
lower oil and raw material prices but the civilian sector
performing better, Jacques Benichou, president of the the
French aeronautics and space industries group GIFAS said.
    He told journalists here that the sales success of the
European Airbus Industrie consortium, in which France has a 38
pct stake through Aerospatiale, and the SNECMA aeroengine
group, which has a 50 pct stake in CFM International with the
U.S. Group General Electric, had both performed well.
    Turnover for the French aerospace industry was 74 billion
francs last year, comparable in constant terms with 1985, while
the trade surplus for the industry was around 30 billion
francs.
    "We should be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic,"
Benichou said.

<TITLE>U.K. BANKS OFFER FIXEDRATE MORTGAGES AT 10.2 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Two major U.K. Clearing banks announced
they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a
fixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years,
below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.
    Midland Bank Plc ltMDBL.L> said it has initially allocated
500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc
ltLLOY.L> will offer 300 mln stg.
    Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard
rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a
half a percentage point reduction in leading banks base
lending rates from 11 pct.
    Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely
still well above the new base rate level, although last year
Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans.
    A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the
current level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage book
accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market.
    Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg in outstanding mortgage
loans, but had not estimated its total market share.
    Among other major clearing banks, Barclays Plc ltBCS.L> and
National Westminister Bank Plc ltNWBL.L> said they had no
immediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes.

<TITLE>WRIGHT SAYS HOUSE WILL VOTE TO BLOCK CONTRA AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
the House would vote by a substantial margin to block 40 mln
dlrs in aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels until President
Reagan has accounted for previous assistance.
    Wright, a Texas Democrat, conceded Congress ultimately will
be unable to stop the money but said the House vote expected
later today will tell the White House its contra program  one
of Reagans pet projects  is in trouble.
    "The adminstration must face reality and focus on other ways
to find peace," Wright said.
    The House is voting on legislation that would block for six
months 40 mln dlrs appropriated last year. The administration
has said it intends to start using the money next month to
provide arms and equipment to the rebels.
    "We expect to win by a substantial margin," Wright said.
    The legislation calls on Reagan to account for all previous
aid, including money diverted to the contras from the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran. The scandal over the arms sales and
the diversion of profits to the contras has plunged the Reagan
administration into its deepest crisis.
    The legislation also demands an accounting of 27 mln dlr in
humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress in 1985 and all funds
given to the contras by foreign governments or private
individuals at the urging of the Reagan administration.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the
socalled 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.
    Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he
thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,
"should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could
"play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placed
on production.
    However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92
option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their
income support payments regardless of how much they planted.
    The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two
problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In
addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm
bill, Dole said.
    Dole also repeated his call for an acrosstheboard export
enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union
could help improve U.S. relations with that country.
    Dole said that the United States has made the decision to
trade with Moscow and that its important to offer competitive
prices.
    The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this
year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy
program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets
lost to other suppliers which subsidize.
    Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require
a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called
for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.
    The Reagan administrations proposed farm policy changes
"are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out the
proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.
    Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a
shift in the State Department towards supporting an export
enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he
didnt see any change.
    Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate
whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.
    Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican
David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky DNeb.

Harland Stonecipher said the companys sales growth rate for
each of the next five years would substantially exceed the
average 100 pct recorded over each of the last few years.
    Addressing analysts, Stonecipher declined to give specific

with I.C.H. Corp ltICH>, under which PrePaid is slated to
receive 10 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, PrePaid earned 2.5 mln dlrs on sales of 42.4 mln

    Stonecipher said the companys product will be marketed
through at least two I.C.H. subsidiaries. The agreement with
I.C.H. will provide access to all 50 states from PrePaids

<TITLE>DOLE MULLS BILL TO EXTEND ETHANOL TAX EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
Dole RKan. said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are
considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax
exemption through the year 2000.
    Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association
board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural
task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.
    Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a
six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise
tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.
    Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness
firms including Archer Daniels Midland ADM and A.E. Staley.
The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite
a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER ltC> SELLS BONDS FROM ITS PORTFOLIO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp today sold 405 mln dlrs
of corporate bonds from its nearly 3.5 billion dlr pension fund
to Wall Street investment bankers, vice president and treasurer
Fred Zuckerman said.
    He said this was the first of two planned sales of
corporate issues from the funds portfolio. Zuckerman said
Chrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs of
corporates.
    "Phase two the second sale will be in a month or so," the
Chrysler executive said, adding that proceeds will be invested
exclusively in the equities market.
    Before todays sale of corporate bonds, those securities
had comprised roughly two thirds of the pension fund portfolio.
    "After the two sales, equities will amount to 50 pct or
more of the portfolio," Zuckerman said.
    "We believe that the equity market has much more upside
potential than the bond market," the executive said. "Interest
rates are not coming down and I would not bet a lot that they
will drop sharply."
    He added, "I personally think interest rates may decline by
50 basis points at the most this year."
    Zuckerman said the 405 mln dlr bond sale was composed of
139 separate issues.
    "Sixty pct were utilities, 20 pct were issued by foreign
governments or corporations, and 20 pct were financial
institutions," he detailed.
    The Chrysler treasurer said that the corporate paper had
typically an 18year maturity. "The securities were longterm,
highquality bonds, mostly rated AAminus or Aplus," he said.
    Zuckerman said Chrysler sold the corporate bonds at about
1.6 pct above yesterdays closing prices for these issues.
"That showed our portfolio is desirable," he commented.
    Corporate bond traders noted that Chryslers sale occurred
against the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market.
    They said they believed that Chrysler was sold the
corporates at a large profit because the issues were bought by
the automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were much
higher.
    Chryslers Zuckerman said his company sold the corporate
issues to four large Wall Street securities firms.
    He said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc bought most of the bonds. However, Zuckerman declined to
name the other two houses.
    Yesterday, Chrysler presented four investment bankers with
a list of bonds and asked them to submit bids by this morning.
    Zuckerman said that Morgan Stanley bought more corporate
bonds than any one of the other three houses.
    Wall Street sources said they believed First Boston Corp
and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets were also in on the bidding
for the corporate bonds. They believed these two firms were
awarded bonds by the carmaker as well.
    A spokesman for Morgan declined to comment and referred
inquiries to Chrysler. Officials at Salomon, First Boston and
Merrill Lynch were unavailable for immediate comment.

<TITLE>PERU GUERRILLAS INTERRUPT TRAIN ROUTE TO MINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed
two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on
Perus sole railway line linking the capital to the central
Andes, where most of the countrys mining centres are located,
authorities said.
    Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast
yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train
laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line.
    Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today
after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at
Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima.
    An official at Mineroperu comercial Minpeco, Perus state
minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the
situation. There had not been a declaration of force majeure on
contracts to ship minerals abroad.
    Foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals
earn Peru over half of its export income. Most of the minerals,
extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are
shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC ltTGT></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
said.
    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to
make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.
    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
    Tenneco rose two points to 483/4.
    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleansbased Howard,
Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
attempt.
    "Its pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
group may be interested," Feretti said.
    "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
challenge."
    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
Dallasbased Diamond Shamrock Corp ltDIA> last winter, has made
no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
    Feretti conservatively estimated Tennecos breakup value at
58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to
Pickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
well into the 60 dlr a share range.
    "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
takeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Incs Houstonbased analyst
John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
    "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
in longterm debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the
buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems"
Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
businesses.
    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
spin off some of its nonenergy businesses directly to
shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his
holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "I
dont think he would be willing to take on Tennecos problems
with Case the farm equipment unit, which has been losing
about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
dlrs on the market today."

<TITLE>PLACER ltPLC> TO INCREASE STAKE IN EQUITY SILVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>ltEquity Silver
Mines Ltd> said it agreed to sell 6.6 mln shares of a new class
of par value voting stock to Placer Development Ltd for 37.1
mln dlrs, increasing Placers stake in Equity to 74.5 pct from
68 pct.
    The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a
vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual
meeting, the company said.
    Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs
each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of
silver to Placer, Equity said.
    Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under
its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000
ounce minimum commitment for 1987.
    Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of
silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to
Placer.
    Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result
in an aftertax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.
    It also said the stock and silver transactions will create
a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when
cash is available.
    The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay
dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood
that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the
company said.
    It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might
be paid.
    The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends
totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver
said.
    Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at
December 31, 1986.

<TITLE>BRAZILS SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SANTOS, BRAZIL, MARCH 11  </DATELINE><BODY>With troops in place in Brazils
ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose
Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of
force.
    Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported
in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and
six areas of oil production.
    The stateoil company Petrobras requested the intervention
because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry
employees.
    The government had already dispatched more than 1,000
marines to occupy the countrys main ports after a national
seamens strike was ruled illegal last Friday.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,
represents a stern challenge to the government.
    The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil
desperately needs foreign exchange.
    It was a deterioration in the countrys trade balance which
precipitated Brazils current debt crisis and the decision on
February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial debt.
    There was no sign today of an early end to the seamens
strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos  the most
important in South America  and the countrys other main
ports.
    Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on
the quays near the strikebound ships, but the military
presence here is generally discreet.
    A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are
out of sight.
    Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the
Docemarte, seamens leaders said. After explaining to the
captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because
the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.
    One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said "it is a
psychological war. They are using force and we are using
peaceful methods."
    Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the
Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.
    At the seamens national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are
strikebound in Brazil and in foreign ports.
    Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in
Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board
ships here were not running out of food.
    The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarneys
civilian government since it came to power two years ago.
    Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of
farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank
interest rates.
    The current rash of labour unrest in industry and
agriculture stems from the failure of the governments
nowcollapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PROCEDURAL VOTE OPPOSES CONTRA AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House of Representatives,
in a key procedural vote, today opposed a grant of 40 mln dlrs
to the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan accounts for
previous aid, including proceeds from U.S. Arms sales to Iran.
    The major test of House sentiment came several hours before
the chamber was to take a final vote on the assistance.
    However, the 227 to 198 vote on a procedural matter was
seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has made aid to the
"contra" rebels one of his major foreign policy initiatives.
   Congressional leaders, including foes of contra aid, have
acknowledged that despite todays rebuff, which was expected,
it will be virtually impossible to prevent the 40 mln dlrs,
which was approved last year, from going through.
    Even if the Senate goes along with the House in postponing
the aid, Reagan will veto the legislation and Congress is not
expected to be able to override the veto.
    But House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, said
todays vote was important because it would "send a message" to
Reagan that his contra program was in trouble.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A Bank of Italy circular that gives the
green light for Italian banks to establish merchant banking
units stipulates that such units must have a minimum capital of
50 billion lire.
    The circular, which renders operative a previously detailed
resolution agreed by a government interministerial committee
last month, will open the door for wider participation by
Italian banks in merchant banking activities.
    Previously, such activities were essentially confined to
state banks operating special credit sections to provide
medium and longterm loans to industry.
    The circular also stipulates that merchant banks set up by
banks can have debts totaling a maximum of double their
capital.
    It also stipulates that the total amount of risk capital
that a merchant bank can hold in its portfolio must not exceed
the value of the banks own combined capital and reserves.
    No investment in any single company must exceed 20 pct of
the combined value of the merchant banks capital and reserves.
    The merchant banks may not acquire, either directly or
indirectly, controlling stakes in companies in which they
invest.

<TITLE>ADMINISTRATION SAID LAX ON ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A group of state officials and a key
U.S. senator said a corporate merger wave was harming the
economy and blamed the Reagan administration for laxness in
enforcing the federal antitrust laws.
    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the
Senate Judiciary Committees Antitrust Subcommittee, also
cautioned the Department of Justice DOJ to comply with his
request for a listing of each case since 1980 in which
department officials had rejected a staff recommendation to
prosecute a suspected antitrust violation.
    Metzenbaum had asked for the data by Monday, but the DOJ
failed to meet the deadline and later hinted it might refuse to
comply.
    Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Charles
Rule defended the administrations record on antitrust
enforcement and told the panel at todays hearing that the
department was in the process of preparing a response to
Metzenbaums request.
    "We have nothing to hide, but we have to be concerned about
our institutional interests," Rule said. He provided no
explanation of what those interests were.
    Metzenbaum said he had scheduled the hearings and requested
the data out of concern "that this administration has abandoned
the nations historical commitment to effective antitrust
enforcement."
    "The green light is on," he said. "Merger mania is rampant
in this country...and it is not serving us well."
    Rule countered that the low inflation and interest rates
and the continuing economic expansion meant the
administrations policies were working well.
    He said simply looking at the number of challenges filed
against pending mergers was misleading because there was no
reason to believe that a fixed proportion of all mergers were
anticompetitive.
    "If you look at the individual cases rather than the
statistics, you will see that we are appropriately enforcing
the antitrust laws," Rule said.
    Metzenbaums view, however, was bolstered by the National
Association of Attorneys General, a group of top state law
enforcement officials.
    "The federal assault on antitrust has been comprehensive,"
Robert Abrams, attorney general of New York and chairman of the
groups antitrust committee, told the panel.
    "The reduction in enforcement has been exacerbated by
federal attempts to prevent both state attorneys general and
private parties from enforcing the law in accordance with its
clear meaning and Supreme Court interpretations," Abrams said.
    The group has drafted its own merger guidelines to bring
uniformity to the attorney generals efforts to enforce the
laws at the state level.

    He said Wrights proposal differed from user fees, which

<TITLE>OKLAHOMA BANKING CHIEF WILL APPEAL CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. March 11, Reuter  </DATELINE><BODY>State Banking
Commissioner Robert Empie, ordered removed from office in an
alleged insider trading scheme, plans to fight the charges, an
aide said today.
    "There will be a hearing on the allegations," a spokeswoman
said, when Empie returns from a meeting outside the state.
    Governor Henry Bellmon yesterday issued an executive order
removing Empie from office "by reason of his incompetence,
malfeasance and neglect of duty."
    Bellmon said Empie held or controlled more than 50,000
shares of stock in United Oklahoma Bank, a firm whose assets he
regulated. He said the commisssioner used "information available
to him only by reason of his position as commissioner to
determine when to sell or attempt to sell shares of stock."
    The order gave Empie 20 days to request a hearing,
something his aide indicated he planned to do. In the meantime
he was suspended from office.
    "Empie intentionally misled the state of Oklahoma into
believing that he had removed hmself from any potential
conflict of interest by placing the ... shares in a socalled
blind trust beyond his control, when in fact Empie continued to
be infomred of the assets in the trust and the value of those
assest and remained in control of their disposition, as shown
by his transfer of the shares on or about December 23, 1985,"
Bellmon said.

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN FCOJ OFFICIAL WELCOMES U.S. DUTY CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Mario Branco Peres, president of
the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries
Abrassuco, welcomed a decision by the U.S. Commerce
Department sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen
concentrated orange juice FCOJ from Brazil.
    Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, "With its
decision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty of
Brazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising
dumping."
    In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminated
the duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct
the duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set last
October.
    Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs
of its major clients.
    "We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we
certainly have enough orange juice available to supply our
buyers," Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the
current stock. "To keep it a secret is part of our strategy," he
added.
    Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based
on market conditions.
    "There is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said.
    Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediately
available for comment.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO KEEP TRADE SURPLUS 35 YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>South Korean Trade Minister Rha
Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for
three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.
    He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years
it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods
and move toward a more balanced trade position.
    He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation
was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
    Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a
trade surplus  4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 
900 mln dlrs.
    Rha made his remarks at the end of a twoweek trade mission
here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products
valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.
    About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of
the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.
    Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian
officials and businessmen.
    Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if
Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this
moment, we have no thought of retaliation."
    South Korea is a major exporter to the U.S. of textiles and
apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video
cassette records and personal computers.
    Its purchases from the United States include electronic
testing equipment, grains and cotton.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA MOVES CLOSER TO CHAMPLIN PURCHASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 11  </DATELINE><BODY>the council of ministers approved
petroleos de venezuelas planned purchase of a half interest in
the champlin petroleum refinery at corpus christi, texas,
government sources said.
    The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo
hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders
assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela
pdvsa.
    Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half
interest in champlins corpus christi refinery for an
undisclosed sum.
    Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela
would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a
new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and
champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp ltunp>.
    The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlins
refinery and distribution network.
    The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures
by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some
400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports.
    Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting
that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the
champlin refinery  33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude
oil and products.
    Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the
sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products.
    Hernandez said pdsva has entered similar joint ventures
with veba oel of west germany, nynas petroelum in sweden, and
citgo in the united states.

shareholder approval at its April 27 annual meeting of a
recapitalization plan calling for the distribution of one Class

would be entitled to at least the same dividend as each Class B
share, which would not be freely transferrable for five years

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Dart Group Corp ltDARTA>, which wants
to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is
not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks
another buyer, arbitrageurs said.
    Speculation that Darts offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could
be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets
shares gain one to 421/8  on 2.3 mln shares.
    One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc ltFDS> taking
a look at Supermarkets General. "Our policy is that we do not
comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature," a
Federated spokeswoman said.
    An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman
Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its
initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when
Safeway resisted.
    However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that
topped the Hafts.
    If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid
to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the
arbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts
present bid seemed "quite fair." He said the offer amounts to
10 times aftertaxcash flow which is "probably fully priced."

<TITLE>ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL ltROK> SELLS 10YEAR NOTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp is raising
200 mln dlrs through an offering of notes due 1997 yielding
7.682 pct, said lead underwriter Daiwa Securities America Inc.
    An officer on Daiwas corporate syndicate desk said he
believed this was Rockwells first debt offering since 1984,
when the company tapped the Euromarkets.
    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,
has become the first foreign bookrunner in the U.S. corporate
debt market this year. The firm is sustaining a trend that
first emerged in early 1986, investment bankers said.
    Daiwa headed a syndicate that won the Rockwell notes in
competitive bidding. Rockwell has a net interest charge of
7.722 pct for the issue, the Daiwa officer said.
    The Japanese firm bid the notes at 98.473 and set a coupon
of 71/2 pct and reoffering price of 98.75 to yield 46 basis
points more than comparable Treasury securities.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
46 basis point spread over Treasuries was aggressive. They said
a premium of 50 basis points or more would have been more
appropriate. "It looks like Daiwa submitted a kamikaze bid just
to get the business," said one competitor.
    However, the Daiwa officer defended his firms pricing of
the deal.
    "Because Rockwell has not floated debt since 1984, the
companys note issue is a museum piece," he said.
    The officer said he believed the Rockwell paper would sell
quickly, mostly because the company is well known and has not
tapped the debt market in three years.
    "Investors are hungry for highgrade debt issued by
household names," agreed one corporate bond trader.
    Noncallable for seven years, the issue is rated Aa2 by
Moodys and AA by Standard and Poors.
    Daiwa became the second foreign firm to manage an offering
in the domestic debt market in September 1986 when it won in
competitive bidding 125 mln dlrs of 10year first mortgage
bonds of General Telephone Co of California, a unit of GTE Corp
ltGTE>.
    It followed the lead of UBS Securities Inc, the U.S. unit
of Union Bank of Switzerland. UBS won its first deal in June
1986 when it bid for, and won, 100 mln dlrs of AlliedSignal
Inc ltALD> debentures due 2016.
    UBS brought two negotiated deals to the marketplace after
that.
    UBS led in late June an offering of 100 mln dlrs of
fiveyear notes issued by Transamerica Financial Corp, a
subsidiary of Transamerica Corp ltTA>. That following September
UBS priced as sole underwriter 100 mln dlrs of BorgWarner Corp
ltBOR> notes due 1991.
    In early December Nomura Securities International Inc
became the third, and so far last, foreign securities firm to
manage a U.S. offering. The U.S. unit of Nomura Securities Co
Ltd of Japan, acting as sole underwriter, won in competitive
bidding 250 mln dlrs of extendible notes of General Electric
Credit Corp, a subsidiary of General Electric Co ltGE>.
    The Rockwell deal is Daiwas second as lead underwriter.
    Last December, Daiwa and Nomura were named primary dealers
by the Federal Reserve, along with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg,
Towbin Inc and Security Pacific National Bank.
    UBS, Nikko Securities Co International Inc and Yamaichi
International America Inc have also applied to the Fed for
primary dealership status.
    Primary dealers are considered an elite group of firms
because they are approved to purchase U.S. Treasury securities
directly from the Feds agent, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, investment bankers explained.

<TITLE>CHANGES SET IN DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Wall Street Journal said the
stocks of OwensIllinois Inc ltOI> and Inco Ltd ltN> will be
dropped as components of the 30 stock Dow Jones Industrial
aveage, effective with the start of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange tomorrow.
    They will be replaced with CocaCola Co ltKO> and Boeing Co
ltBA>.
    The paper, which is published by Dow Jones and Co Inc ltDJ>,
said the change in components will require revision of the
divisors used to calculate the industrial average and the
related 65 stock composite index to maintain the statistical
continuity of the indices. The new divisors will be published
in tommorws editon, it added.
    It explained that OwensIllinois, which has been one of the
Dow 30 since 1959, is the object of a leveraged buyout. The
tender offer is set to expire March 16.
    The Journal said Inco is being dropped to substitute a
stock that will make the index more representative of the
market. Previously named International Nickel Co, Inco is one
of the original components of the index established in 1928.
    While the OwensIllinois deletion was forced, the Inco
substitution is being made solely to improve the marketsector
weighting of the index, not because of any change in the
company, the paper stated. Such substitutions are made from
time to time, most recently with the addition of McDonalds
Corp ltMCD> in October 1985, to reflect longrun changes in the
economy and the market, it added.

<TITLE>PANHANDLE ltPEL> TRIMS TAKEORPAY EXPOSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Panhandle Eastern Corp said it had made
steady progress in reducing its natural gas takeorpay
exposure from 4.9 billion dlrs to 1.7 billion dlrs worth of
potential claims.
    Panhandle Eastern chairman R.L. OShields said settlement
payments of 247 mln dlrs plus releases and waivers of gas
purchase obligations since 1982 had reduced the companys
takeorpay exposure.
    "While substantial, we believe the unresolved takeorpay
exposure will remain manageable," he said in a letter to
shareholders that appeared in the companys new annual report.
    Panhandle Eastern also said it had budgeted 78 mln dlrs for
its 1987 capital spending program, an increase from 65 mln dlrs
spent last year. The company said its primary focus of 1987
spending would be to modernize and automate its pipelines for
greater efficiency.
    Houstonbased Panhandle Eastern earned 133.5 mln in 1986 on
revenues of 2.0 billion, compared to net income of 113.1 mln on
sales of 2.5 billion in 1985.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission has
told EC member states that it is not prepared to discuss EC
sugar prices while sugar traders threaten to make a huge sale
into intervention stocks to protest against its policies,
Commission sources said.
    "Our position is that we are not willing to discuss the
problems of market prices at a time when traders are making
threats," one source said.
    The sources said the Commissions view was made clear at a
meeting of its sugar management committee today.
    They said French, West German and Dutch officials had
informed the committee that traders in their countries intended
to sell just over 850,000 tonnes of sugar into EC intervention
stocks.
    The Commission riposted by signalling that it would sell
the sugar sold into intervention back onto the EC market by
tender, a move that would push down prices.
    The sources said French traders planned to sell 775,000
tonnes into intervention stocks, West German traders 7,500
tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500.

<TITLE>BILL TO EXTEND ETHANOL EXEMPTION CONSIDERED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Republican leader Robert Dole
RKan. said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are
considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax
exemption through the year 2000.
    Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association
board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural
task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.
    Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a
six cts per gallon exemption from a nine cts federal excise
tax. The exemption is to expire at the end of 1992.
    Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness
firms including Archer Daniels Midland ADM, and A.E. Staley.
The tax exemption has helped helped bolster ethanol production
despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO MAINTAIN TRADE SURPLUS 35 YEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>South Korean Trade Minister Rha
Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for
three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.
    He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years
it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods
and move toward a more balanced trade position.
    He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation
was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
    Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a
trade surplus  4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900
mln dlrs.
    Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its
foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I think
so."
    Rha made his remarks at the end of a twoweek trade mission
here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products
valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.
    About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the
type South Korea normally bought from Japan.
    Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks
with Canadian officials and businessmen.
    He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce
his countrys 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States
and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.
    Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates
between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy
U.S. goods than Japanese goods.
    He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he
hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to
resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.
    Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a
solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions."
    But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions
because of domestic political reasons."
    Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of
concessions already."
    He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in
industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity
and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by
strengthening protection of copyrights and patents.
    Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.
    Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if
Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this
moment, we have no thought of retaliation."
    South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of
textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television
sets, video cassette records and personal computers.
    Its puchases from the United States include electronic
testing equipment and grains and cotton.
    The trade missions purchases here included three Boeing
passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas
planes for 300 mln dlrs and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs.

sales, service and support operations of its Rolm Corp unit
with the marketing support operations of its Information
Systems Group.
    IBM said the new group is responsible for direct sales,
installation and service of the Rolm product line as well as
other IBM telecommunications products.
    IBM acquired Rolm, a Santa Clara, Calif.based maker of
telephone swichboards and other telecommunications equipment,
in 1984.
    Analysts in the past have criticized IBM for not moving
faster to integrate Rolms telecommunications products with its
computer systems.
    But Edward E. Lucente, an IBM vice president and group
executive of the Information Systems Group, said in a
statement, "This is an important step toward providing a single
IBM marketing and service organization to increase our focus on
our customers telecommunications products needs."
    IBM said Jack W. Blumenstein, a Rolm vice president and
head of its Business Communications Group, will take charge of
the new telecommunications organization, which will operate as
a unit within the Information Systems Group.
    Blumenstein was named an assistant group executive of the
Information Systems Group and he will report to Lucente, IBM
said.
    IBM said the new organization will oversee the technical
and marketing support of Rolm and IBM telecommunications
products but will not be responsible for sales and marketing of
IBM gear.
    IBM said Rolm will retain responsibility for the worldwide
manufacture and development of Rolm products. Rolm will also
continue to direct the sale of its products by Rolm
distributors in the United States and overseas.
    At the same time, IBM said its Communications Products
Division will continue to direct the worldwide development and
U.S. manufacture of IBMs nonRolm telecommunications products.
    Dennis D. Paboojian, Rolms president, will continue to
report to IBM senior vice president Allen J. Krowe, IBM said.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Detroit Edison Co said it has nearly
completed the 50 pct power level testing of its Fermi 2 nuclear
power plant near Monroe, Mich.
    The company said it is preparing to ask the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for the goahead to enter the next series
of tests at up to the 75 pct power level.
    Detroit Edison also said because of a decision to modify
Fermis reheating apparatus, the company has set back the
schedule for the plants commercial operation run to early June
from May One.
    Detroit Edison said with interest and other charges running
about 1.0 mln dlrs a day, the delay caused by reheater
modifications will add approximately 30 mln dlrs to the plants
cost, raising the estimated total cost to 4.26 billion dlrs
from 4.23 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>U.S. AGENCIES DISAGREE OVER IRAN COMPUTER SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Two U.S. government agencies are in
dispute over a proposal for U.S. firms to sell computers to
Iran, officials said.
    The Commerce Department said it intends to approve export
licenses for two firms to sell computers and related equipment
to the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency and the Iran Power
Generation Transmission, spokesman B. Jay Cooper said.
    The export companies were not identified, but the sales
included computers made by Digital Equipment Co ltDEC> of
Maynard, Mass.
    Hightechnology exports must be approved by the departments
of Commerce, Defense and State.
    The Pentagon will appeal Commerces approval of the sales
because the technology could be turned against U.S. national
security, Commander Bob Prucha, a Pentagon spokesman, said.
    The Pentagon will ask the National Security Council in the
White House to prohibit the sales.
    Cooper said the State Department did not object to the
sales, but Secretary of State George Shultz indicated he may
weigh in against the deal.
    Under questioning by Rep. Jack Kemp RNY at a hearing,
Shultz said he was unaware that the Commerce Department was
preparing to grant export licenses for the sale of computers.
    "Im not in favor of sales to Iran" of advanced U.S.
technology, Shultz said.
    The Commerce Department has argued that excessive
restrictions hurt U.S. companies that compete with foreign
exporters.
    Cooper said the technology in the Iranian sales was
available elsewhere and that foreign companies would get the
Iran business if the U.S. export licenses were not approved.

<TITLE>OREGON LUMBER COMPANY TO SELL WOOD TO IRAQ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     PORTLAND, Oregon, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A Portlandbased wood
products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the
Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq,
Edward Niedermeyer, president of NiedermeyerMartin Co said
yesterday.
    Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the
sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber
exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs.
    The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in
addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of
Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity
under the credit guarantee program, he said.
    Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee
program GSM102 administered by the USDA was the key to
opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by
Scandinavian lumber producers.
    "This is the first time we have been able to sell wood
products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would
not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term
export market for U.S. lumber products."
    He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet
to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing,
construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the
profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six
pct.
    Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale
late last month and early March. He is a member of the United
StatesIraq Business Forum, a nonprofit group designed to
promote commerce with Iraq.
    The forum members include Westinghouse and General
Electric, but Niedermeyers company is the only wood products
firm on the membership roster.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The recent purchase of 1.5 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea
suggests that the two countries demand for reliable supplies
of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in
exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the
availability of South African and Chinese corn.
    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7
mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 SeptAug, nearly 400,000
tonnes greater than yearago figures to date.
    South Koreas cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln
tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.

<TITLE>FRANCO NEVADA SAYS STOCK RISE DUE TO DRILLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Toronto, March 10  </DATELINE><BODY>ltFranco Nevada Mining Corp Ltd> said
the gain in its stock price today is related to deep drilling
being conducted by American Barrick Resources Corp ltABXFF> at
the Goldstrike claims in the Carlin camp in northern Nevada.
    Franco Nevada stock is up two at seven dlrs per share on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Franco Nevada said American Barrick announced on March nine
that the drilling indicated a number of significant
intersections of sulfide gold mineralization below a depth of
about 1,000 feet.
    One vertical drill hole intersected gold continuously from
1,100 feet to 1,730 feet averaging 0.30 ounces per ton, the
announcement said.
    Extensive drilling continues at Goldstrike, the company
said, adding that the full economic value of the property
cannot be assessed until further results are available.
    Franco Nevada said it has a four pct royalty plus a five
pct net profit interest on the acreage. Those holdings are part
of more than 3,400 acres of mineral rights held by Franco
Nevada in the Carlin gold belt.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 11  </DATELINE><BODY>An 11dayold strike by
Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead
to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.
    They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed
but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by
Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been
disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.
    A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant
Brazils coffee exports have been running at an average two
weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source
added.
    By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags
behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped
during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,
the sources said.
    Given Brazils port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags
a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and
not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee
will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

<TITLE>ALCOA DECLINES SPECIFIC COMMENT ON OPTIONS TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Alcoa officials acknowledged the
possibility that they may have a position in the offexchange
aluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade
speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding
position.
    An Alcoa Aluminum Company of America source involved in
terminal trading for the company said "We use all means
available to manage our business, so its a possibility were
trading options."
    "We wont go into specifics about what were doing. But
when youre dealing in unalloyed ingot, its a commodity
business where there are a lot of tools available for hedging
and Alcoa is using all of those tools," said Al Posti, Alcoas
manager of corporate news.
    Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to
30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and
May. However, some New Yorkbased aluminium traders said they
believe the size of Alcoas position has been exaggerated.
    The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one
factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the
second quarter, traders said.
    "If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would
mean really squeezing the market," one New York trader said,
noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were
90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SAY NEW DOW COMPONENTS AID AVERAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street market analysts said two
changes in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
were part of a shift away from smokestack industries that have
long dominated the 30stock index.
    "It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst at
Advest Inc. He said CocaCola Co ltKO>, one of the two
additions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to a
smokestack." He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd ltN>, "a
super stock at one time that hasnt done much lately."
    The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to add
Boeing Co ltBA> and dropping OwensIllinois Inc ltOI>.
    Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgy
number." But he noted that putting two new stocks in an average
of 30 is a relatively minor change.
    "This will distinctly make the index more useful," said
Frank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement of
the market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift to
Coke."
    But he said Shearsons aerospace analyst today removed
Boeing from the firms recommended list, taking it from a buy
to a hold. Korth said Boeings business appeared to be leaning
too heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.
    Prior to tomorrows market opening the Wall Street Journal
will publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.
LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but will
probably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in the
year due to forthcoming splits in components such as
International Paper Co ltIP>.
    The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,
dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The
0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 12.5 cts in the
price of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in the
index.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The senior Republican on the U.S.
Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, called
for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American
shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers.
    "Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at
the expense of American farmers and dockworkers," Lugar said in
signing on as a cosponsor or cargo preference repeal
legislation.
    The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships
rather than foreign vessels which are less costly.

<TITLE>HOUSE DEMOCRATS DRAFTING BUDGET AT SNAILS PACE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Democrats on the House Budget
Committee, meeting behind closed doors to draft the outlines of
next years federal budget, say their work is proceeding at a
snails pace.
    In a series of interviews, panel members conceded that the
budget panels drafting sessions, which began yesterday and
were initially expected to end late tomorrow, will now extend
into next week.
    "Weve a long ways to go," Rep. Martin Frost DTex.. told
Reuters.
    "We are not making the progress that we should," said Rep.
Vic Fazio DCalif..
    Members also acknowledged that the panels preliminary 
goal for spending cuts and new revenues would not be enough to
enable the government to meet the 108 billion dlr deficit
ceiling set for the coming year by federal law.
    Budget Commitee Chairman William Gray DPa., interviewed
during a break in the lawmakers secret deliberations, said the
committee was still debating the shape of the overall budget
and had come to no agreement on the size or precise form of the
new revenues or spending cuts to be pursued.
    But the lawmakers said the House Democratic leadership has
asked the panel to come up with a package of 36 billion dlrs in
deficitreducing measures.
    The package would include 18 billion dlrs in new revenues,
nine billion dlrs in military spending cuts and nine billion
dlrs in domestic spending reductions, they said.
    The Democratic lawmakers said they were still trying to
meet those goals but had made no firm decisions.
    In particular, the legislators said they were having
trouble coming up with the nine billion dlrs in military
spending cuts.
    "Were talking in the range of 1520 billion dlrs in new
revenues, but if we cant come up with the full amount of
defense cuts, we would have to raise more in new revenues,"
Fazio said.
    The particular manner in which new revenues would be raised
also has not been decided, the lawmakers said.
    House Speaker Jim Wright DTexas has urged passage of a
tax on securities transactions to bring an estimated 20 billion
dlrs in new revenues into the U.S. Treasury.
    But the administration is totally opposed to such a tax, a
top official told Reuters yesterday.
    The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
said the administration also opposed another suggestion by
Wright that the administration delay next years cut in the top
tax rate, called for in the recent tax overhaul law.
    The Congressional Democrats first hinted about two weeks
ago that they would seek to reduce the deficit by about 36
billion dlrs and put aside the question of whether the effort
would meet the 108 billion dlr deficit target set for fiscal
year 1988 by the new federal balanced budget law.
    The administration has predicted that approval of 42
billion dlrs in deficit reductions would meet the target.
    Its budget plan, submitted in January, called for 1.024
trillion dlrs in spending on revenues of 916 billion dlrs.
    But the Congressional Budget Office has said the
administration forecast was based on overly optimistic
assumptions about the economy.
    The nonpartisan office said the administrations budget
plan, if adopted, would yield a deficit of 134 billion dlrs,
missing the deficit target by 26 billion dlrs and.

<TITLE>BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture
Departments fourth conservation signup is expected to be
announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be
higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.
    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,
USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in
the 10year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.
    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into
the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDAs
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a
congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be
accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.
    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is
expected to attract the greatest enrollment.
    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which
well get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.
    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the
acreage pulled from that area, he said.
    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage
in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,
but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small
percent of the total.
    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part
of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more
interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.
    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take
land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment
accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.

<TITLE>MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Heavy rains fell again in
Argentinas main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday,
trade sources said.
    Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly
high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and
Santa Fe provinces.
    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,
heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La
Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.
Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.
    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to
31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm
in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in
Chaco.
    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the
rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower
crops may have suffered.
    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by
the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains
would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow
farm machinery to operate.
    The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern
Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas
there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.
    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,
Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after
flying over the flooded area.
    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000
hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that
200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large
parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are
lowlying and flood easily.
    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the
heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of
the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high
winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.
    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south
of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated
areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between
15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct
a week ago.
    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were
revised downward in light of the bad weather.
    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,
down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down
34.1 to 41.5 pct from last years record harvest of 4.1 mln
tonnes.
    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15
pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week
ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2
mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a
week ago.
    Last years maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,
according to official figures.
    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8
to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln
tonnes a week ago. Last years soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln
tonnes, according to official figures.
    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between
four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four
pct a week ago.
    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5
mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes
produced in the last harvest.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS DELAYED FOR CONSULTATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Todays debt rescheduling talks
between the Philippines government and its bank advisory
committee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks more
time to consider Manilas novel proposal for paying part of its
interest bill in notes instead of cash, bankers said.
    The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided
that they needed more time in particular to consider a news
report which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging
that the proposal be given serious consideration.
    "The banks felt that this was new information and that
further consultation was called for," one banker said.    
    In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted the
official as saying Manilas plan to pay some interest with
notes that could be converted into equity investments in the
Philippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration
strategy for handling developing country debt.
    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, its quite
unique and I dont think its something that should be
categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.
    Because of the key role the U.S. plays in the debt crisis,
foreign banks in particular wanted time to analyze the
significance of the policymakers comments, bankers said.

<TITLE>HUGHES ltHT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER ltBKO></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool
Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
required by the U.S. Justice Department.
     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
funding limit.
    The BakerHughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
business.
    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
merger.
    Hughes Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
Hughes shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
agreement had proposed a threemonth period.
    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
consider granting, if necessary, an additional threemonth
extension to complete the sale.
    He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic
drilling bit business.
    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial
cutbacks" in the 20,000member workforce at BakerHughes Inc,
the name the merged company will take.
    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that
in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
something close to breakeven," he said.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs
on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.
    Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost
34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>INCO ltN> SEES NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM DOW REMOVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Inco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the companys stock.
    "We dont think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 13/8 lower at 193/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Cherney, asked about the stock price slide, said "I dont
think we can speculate. It appears to be a reaction but we have
no control over the content of the Dow Jones."
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the nonCommunist worlds largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Cherney said Inco did not view the move as a blow to its
prestige.
    "I dont see any change in that area. We havent used that
factor Dow membership as part of our promotional material,"
he said.
    Replacing Inco and OwensIllinois Inc ltOI> will be
CocaCola Co ltKO> and Boeing Co ltBA>, effective tomorrow.
    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran
Murray Ltd said Incos removal from the index would likely
spark shortterm selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, Well,
because its not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment, " said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious longterm impact on Inco stock.
    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower
nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in
1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>HARPER ltHPR> GETS BID FROM HARCOURT ltHBJ></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Harper and Row Publishers Inc said it
received an acquisition offer from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
INc to acquire all of Harper and Rows shares at 50 dlrs a
share in cash.
    Harper said it will consider the proposal, including such
possible concerns as antitrust and other legal considerations.
    On Monday, Harper and Row received a surprise 34 dlra
share bid from investor Theodore Cross, owner of six pct of the
shares, for the stock he does not own.
     Harcourt made clear in its offer that it will step aside
if Harpers directors and shareholders reject the bid, Harper
said.
    Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong
determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise.
    Harper also said that New World Pictures, a shareholder,
has requested a copy of Harpers shareholder list to be used in
soliciting proxies.
    New World has 30,800 shares of the total 4.4 mln shares.
    Harper and Rows stock closed off 3/4 to 331/2 after
rising 91/4 points yesterday.
    Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders
rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers.
    Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with the investment banking for
of Sterling Grace and Co said Harper and Row is one of the few
remaining independent publishers with a "back list" of authors
stretching back 200 years.
    He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with
the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture
and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing
technologies make new editions a profitable business.
    "Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is
willing to pay up for it," Obolensky said. But he said Harper
and Row "has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid.

<TITLE>PLAN TO CUT DELAYS ADVANCES AT SEVEN AIRPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Department of Transportation
DOT said it would go ahead at seven airports with a
controversial plan to reduce airline delays by enabling
competing companies to coordinate their schedules.
    Under the plan, the DOT will grant the airlines immunity
from the antitrust laws so they can redistribute their flight
times over the day and avoid the clustering of flights that
typically occurs at the most desirable travel times.
    Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she had
decided to grant unconditional immunity to the carriers serving
Atlantas Hartsfield and Chicagos OHare airports.
    At five other airportsDallasFort Worth, Boston, Denver,
Newark and PhiladelphiaDole said she would grant conditional
immunity to enable further government study.
    Under this part of the plan, the carriers serving these
five airports have been asked to give DOT their summer 1987
schedules by the end of the week.
    The agency will then review the schedules and decide by
Monday whether they threaten to cause delays.
    If so, those airports would be added to the list of those
granted wider immunity to enable scheduling talks.
    Dole said she was confident no anticompetitive effects
would result from the talks, which she said would be monitored
by U.S. officials and would be open to the public.
    Flight delays at the nations 22 busiest airports soared in
1986 to 367,000 from 295,000 in 1985. The government believes
most delays are caused by weather.
    The DOT first proposed the immunity plan in late January
and said it might be granted for a total of 13 airports.
    Dropped from the final plan were the MinneapolisSt. Paul,
New YorkLaGuardia, New YorkJ.F. Kennedy, San Francisco, St.
Louis and WashingtonDulles airports.
