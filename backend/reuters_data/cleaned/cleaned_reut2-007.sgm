<TITLE>FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Media group John Fairfax Ltd ltFFXA.S>
said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the
impact of changes in the Australian tax system.
    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to
25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln
a year earlier although pretax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30
mln from 44.29 mln.
    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in
company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on
fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the
company said in a statement.
    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue
growth in the television industry as another reason for the
flat first half earnings.
    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of
these factors.
    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning
Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as
did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely
satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.
    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0
pct rise in revenue, it said.
    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net
earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the
receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from ltAustralian
Associated Press Pty Ltd> AAP after the sale of AAPs "B"
shares in Reuters Holdings Plc ltRTRS.L>.
    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.
    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the
full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr
acquisition of the HSVSeven television station in Melbourne
will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in
Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further
slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its
semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.
    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the
semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cutprice
Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to
take retaliatory action after April 1.
    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling
cutprice chips in world markets and to increase its imports of
American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.
    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been
pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will
boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
of the first quarter.
    If that reduced production level were maintained through to
the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
below that of the first three months of the year.
    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
quarter cutback.
    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there
are picking up.
    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese
semiconductor makers for what they see as heavyhanded attempts
to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.

<TITLE>U.K. CLEARING BANK LENDING RISES 1.6 BILLION STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Clearing bank sterling lending to the
U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by
an underlying, seasonallyadjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2
billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service
said.
    The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an
813 mln stg increase in January.
    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of
1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of
about 1.0 billion stg.
    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal
lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken
up entirely by lending for home purchases.
    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about
182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.
    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,
and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.
    The Banking Information Service said February fell within
the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably
the result of industrys need to pay its tax bills.
    Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1
billion stg in February and by a seasonallyadjusted 1.75
billion stg.
    Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in
February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln.

<TITLE>U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Unemployment in the U.K. Fell a
provisional seasonallyadjusted 44,100 in February, to total
3.07 mln or 11.1 pct of the workforce, the Employment
Department said.
    In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a
revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January
position was reported as flat.
    The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers,
fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in
January.
    February was the seventh successive month that seasonally
adjusted unemployment registered a fall.
    It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer.
    Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared
little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about
20,000, will continue.
    A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February
reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and
continued the downward trend seen in the past six months.
    He said the February fall was spread throughout the country
and among men and women.

<TITLE>STERLING M3 UP 21/4 PCT IN FEBRUARY, M0 DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The main measure of U.K. Broad money,
sterling M3, grew a provisional, seasonally adjusted 21/4 pct
in February after a rise of 1.1 pct in January, the Bank of
England said.
    The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to
one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said.
    Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 183/4 to 19
pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January
while M0 rose four to 41/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in
January.
    Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion
stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion.
    Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending
to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4
billion rise in January, the Bank said.
    The public sector borrowing requirement PSBR contracted
by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in
January.
    Funding  debt sales to the nonbank private sector and
external flows to the public sector  rose by 300 mln stg after
a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government
debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln
stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said.
    Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by
300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg
in January, the Bank said.
    Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 13/4 to
two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January.
    On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 11/2
pct in MO in February after a sharp 61/2 pct fall in January.
    The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March
30.
    The Bank said nonbank private sector holdings of public
sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while
external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg.
    Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg,
the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was
therefore about flat, the Bank said.
    It said seasonally adjusted bank lending, at about 2.9
billion stg in February, compared with an average of about 2.6
billion stg a month over the preceding six months.

<TITLE>U.K. EARNINGS RISE 7.6 PCT IN YEAR TO JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Average earnings rose a seasonally
adjusted 7.6 pct in the year to endJanuary after a 7.4 pct
rise in the year to December, the Department of Employment
said.
    The underlying rise was 7.5 pct after 7.75 pct in December.
    The January index, base 1980, was set at a provisional
seasonally adjusted 190.4, down from 193.4 in December.
    The underlying rise, adjusted for factors such as backpay
and timing variations, had been steady at 7.5 pct from October
1985 to October 1986.
    Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose 3.3 pct
in the three months to end January, on a yearonyear basis,
after a 3.1 pct rise in the three months to end December, the
Department of Employment said.
    In January, the unit wage rise in manufacturing industries
was 3.6 pct, unchanged from the December rise.
    The Department said the decline in the underlying rate of
rise in earnings reflected the reduced significance of bonus
payments in January compared with December.
    The actual increase reflected teacher pay settlements and
industrial action in the transport and communications sectors
in January 1987.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG CONSIDERS RAISING SOME INDIRECT TAXES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said
he was looking for ways to help finance a planned tax reform
without increasing valueadded tax but could not rule out
raising some indirect taxes, for example, on tobacco.
    Stoltenberg also told parliament that closing tax loopholes
would contribute towards the 19 billion marks the government is
seeking to finance part of its 44 billion mark tax reform
package for the 1990s.
    He confirmed that a temporary and limited increase in the
borrowing requirement was also being considered.
    Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday said a temporary rise in
borrowing was acceptable but stressed his government would
exercise strict discipline in spending.
    New net borrowing was 23.0 billion marks in 1986 compared
with 37.2 billion in 1982.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SEEKS 450 MLN DLRS IN EMERGENCY CREDIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jorge Aguirre, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 18  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador is seeking between 437 and 450
mln dlrs in loans this year from multilateral organisations and
foreign governments to grapple with economic losses from a
devastating earthquake 13 days ago, a presidential economic
adviser said.
    Foreign governments and multilateral organisations hold
onethird of Ecuadors 8.16 billion dlrs total foreign debt, he
said in a news conference at the presidential palace.
    But he added that the suspension of payments to private
foreign banks, who hold the rest of the foreign debt, would be
prolonged though the government hoped to negotiate an agreement
with these creditors.
    President Leon Febres Cordero says the earthquake cost the
country one billion dlrs in losses and left 1,000 people dead
or missing.
    Swett, who was Finance Minister of Ecuador between August
1984 to June 1986, added "With the private foreign banks there
has been a ceasing of payments by Ecuador.
    "We are bringing forward the respective negotiations whose
conclusion we hope finalises in the next few weeks."
    Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said last week that
quakehit Ecuador sought through negotiations to postpone all
payments due to the private foreign banks in 1987 until next
year.
    Although Swett gave no gave details on the latest plan for
negotiations with private foreign banks, he calculated the
suspension of payment to these creditors would save the
government 54.45 billion sucres.
    This amount is equal to 363 mln dlrs at the free rate of
150 sucres to the dollar  the rate Swett said reporters
should use in calculating the dollar equivalent.
    The Ecuadorean central bank, which is the institution
remitting debt payments abroad, uses the official rate of 95
sucres to the dollar for its accounting purposes. At the
official rate, the 54.45 billion sucres sum equals 573 mln
dlrs.
    Ecuador, squeezed by a slide last year in prices for crude,
its main export, suspended payments to private foreign banks in
January.
    Swett said the government would also seek to refinance the
1.429 billion dlr section of the debt owed to the Paris Club
group of foreign governments, though it would continue to
service the debt with them. He gave no more details.
    The government adopted a tough austerity program last
Friday intended to grapple with the tremors economic costs.
But the countrys labour unions have called a general strike
for Wednesday to press for a suspension of the program.
    The 500,000strong Unitary Workers Front FUT and the
100,000member General Union of Workers UGT called the strike
to cancel the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices
of up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.
    The leftistled FUT said it was also backing a call by the
Maoist Popular Movement for Democracy MPD party, to have
Congress impeach and oust Febres Cordero, a conservative, for
having adopted the austerity measures.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>ltNippon Life Insurance Co> is pursing a
possible link with an American securities house to expand its
overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said.
    But he declined to comment on rumours the company would
take a 10 pct stake in ltShearson Lehman Brothers>, an
investment banking unit of American Express Co ltAXP>.
    He said the firm started to sound out several U.S.
Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago
and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say
if it had set its sights on one firm.
    Nippon Life, Japans largest life insurer, also plans to
set up a wholly owned investment unit, ltNissei International
America>, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada,
Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said.
    These moves are in line with its longterm strategy to put
more emphasis on overseas investment management as
opportunities at home are declining while the companys assets
are growing.
    The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth
of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm
foothold there, the spokesman added.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES LIQUIDITY RISES, LOAN DEMAND FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Liquidity in the Philippines rose in
December while loan demand and shortterm lending rates fell,
the Central Bank said.
    A bank official said M3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional
149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a month
earlier for a yearonyear gain of 12.72 pct.
    She said shortterm bank lending rates fell to an
annualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct a
month earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985.
    Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial
bank reserves, the official said.
    The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19
billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required
were 21.59 billion.
    She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a
deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64
billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in
the last quarter of 1986.
    Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities,
was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. This
was 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and
41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.
    The bank official noted M3, which includes M1 money
supply, plus savings, time deposits and deposit substitutes.
Was 132.88 billion pesos at the end of December 1985.
    M1 money supply rose a provisional 17.3 pct to 42.86
billion pesos at the end of December 1986 from 36.52 billion a
month earlier. The yearonyear rise was 19.64 pct, up from

<TITLE>NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>There is no question of stimulating
consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other
reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources
close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques
Chiracs spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers
were agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.
    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a
reflationary Uturn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled
out any such move.
    The sources today said the governments policy remained one
of "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.
    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc
revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation
program will go to providing public companies with fresh
capital, 21.4 billion francs, or twothirds, will go toward
paying off national debt.
    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30
billion would be distributed between repayment of national
internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they
added.
    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when
the countrys internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this
year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as
fast as gross domestic product.
    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this
year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with
earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.
    The sources said that with Frances economic targets for
1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the
government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at
an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

<TITLE>H.K. REVIEWS BANKING STRUCTURE, CAPITAL RATIO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Banking Commission is reviewing
the present threetier banking system and its newly established
capital adequacy ratio, banking commissioner Robert Fell said.
    He told a news conference his office has had talks with the
Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on
riskbased capital ratios, following an agreement on such
standards between the two central banks early this year.
    The Bank of England and the Fed are trying to persuade the
Bank of Japan and European central banks to accept their
standards.
    "We welcome international standards," Fell said. "It means a
level playing field for all."
    Under a new banking rule that came into effect last year,
banks in Hong Kong are given a twoyear grace period to meet a
five pct capital adequacy requirement.
    "The difference between us Hong Kong and the U.K. is
really not that great," he said.
    Fell said the majority of banks are comfortable with the
required capital ratio, though some are undercapitalised.
    Some banks, mostly Japanese, want a lower capital ratio
because of the special nature of their business, mainly
offshore banking operations. These institutions have proposed
the creation of a limited service bank category.
    Financial institutions in Hong Kong are now classified into
three types  banks, registered and licensed deposittaking
companies.
    Fell said the Commission is reviewing the threetier
structure in light of the possible changes in capital ratio and
the growing trend towards securitisation of debt.
    Fell said the Commission is also studying a set of
guidelines on loan loss provisions with the help of the Society
of Accountants.
    Other planned guidelines relate to securitisation of debt
and business that banks and deposit taking companies can
conduct.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK  SPENDING, M1</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Brisk increases in personal income and
consumption are to appear in February data released today, but
the bond markets recent sluggishness suggests there will be no
major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than
expected, economists said.
    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,
compared with no change in January, while consumption
expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,
reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.
    M1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be
released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc
expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage
and salary disbursements in February.
    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the
average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by
four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable
goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at
least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.
    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond
market much yesterday, with the 30year Treasury bond slipping
just 7/32 to 9928/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.
    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow
range, desperately seeking direction.
    "Seasonally adjusted, its already December in the bond
market," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co
International Inc.
    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the
steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some
signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations
that inflation will remain subdued.
    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.
    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation
was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned
that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five
pct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in a
report.
    After trading late yesterday at 515/16 pct, Fed funds were
indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 515/16, six pct.

<TITLE>U.S. DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>American soybean producers and processors
are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will
not be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it
is introduced.
    Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Associations first
vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration
would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and
processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.
    U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter
to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more
than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett
said.
    The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association NSPA
delegations will meet top West German government officials
today and tomorrow to lobby for support.
    Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem
to have taken a hardline view on the issue.
    "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their
advantage economically, but that is not correct because we
would hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.
    This step would be very expensive for all and no one would
emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.
    Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean
industry view the EC proposal as violating the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings
agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.
    Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and
products can be exported to the Community dutyfree.

<TITLE>H.K. BANKING SECTOR STABLE, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The banking sector has regained its
stability after a protracted period of difficulty, banking
commissioner Robert Fell said.
    "The banking climate has dramatically changed from a year
ago," he said at a news conference to present his annual report
on the banking sector for 1986.
    "Weve got confidence back. Weve got profitability back." he
said.
    A threeyear shake out in the local banking sector forced
the government to take over three banks and arrange for the
acquisition of four others by the private sector.
    Fell said that in many cases the bank problems stemmed from
management fraud which he linked partly to dramatic swings in
the stock and property markets in the early 1980s.
    "Weve got it out of the system now," he said. "Fraud is no
longer a systemic problem."
    But he acknowledged there may still be problems.
    "Deliberate fraud is difficult to detect especially where
collusion and senior management are involved," he said.
"Prudential supervision cannot give complete protection. The
new banking ordinance is designed to give a "measure" of
protection."
    Fell said a number of banks want to set up operations in
Hong Kong, adding the government approved three banking
licences this week. He did not give details.
    At the end of 1986, there were 151 licenced banks, 25 of
which were locally incorporated, compared with 143 a year ago.
Another 134 foreign banks had representative offices compared
with 131 a year ago.
    There were 34 licensed deposittaking companies DTCs and
254 registered DTCs at the end of 1986, compared with 35 and
278 respectively a year ago, he said.
    Foreign banks seeking banking licences in Hong Kong must
have assets of 14 billion U.S. Dlrs. But Financial Secretary
Piers Jacobs said yesterday the asset criteria are flexible.
    A high asset threshold has worked in the favour of banks
incorporated in countries with relatively large economies, he
noted.
    "No licences in the last few years have been granted to
banks from any of the smaller countries in the AsiaPacific
region," he said.

FHLBB announced today the replacement of a closed Santa Ana,
Calif., savings bank in the 15th federal action assisting
troubled U.S. savings institutions this year.
    The FHLBB said Perpetual Savings Bank in Santa Ana was put
into receivorship because it was insolvent and was replaced by
a new federally chartered Perpetual Savings Association.
    It said the savings banks insolvency "was a direct result
of losses on speculative investments in real estate which were
not supported by appraisals."
    The FHLBB said it appointed Great American First Savings
Bank ltGTA> of San Diego to manage Perpetual Savings.
    It said as of January 31, Perpetual had assets of 61.9 mln
dlrs.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co said it and its
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc subsidiary have been holding talks
on the possible equity investment in Shearson Lehman by ltNippon
Life Insurance Co> of Japan.
    The company said, "The discussions have led to a general
understanding by which Nippon Life would purchase a 13 pct
equity investment in Shearson Lehman for approximately 530 mln
dlrs and American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life
would explore mutually advantageous, nonexclusive business and
investment opportunities."
    The company said a definitive agreement on the matter is
subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the
American Express board and the Japanese Ministry of Finance.
    The company said its board is scheduled to meet March 27
for its regular monthly sessions.
    American Express said it is continuing to evaluate various
courses of action of strategic importance to Shearson Lehman in
addition to the possible investment by Nippon Life.
    It said the options range from expanding Shearsons
capacity to meet international competition, to broadening
further its access to capital.
    The company also said, "All the courses of action under
study reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson Lehman
in American Express worldwide financial services strategy."

<TITLE>S.AFRICAS FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The financial rand, widely viewed
as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South
Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank
economists said.
    The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three
months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs
of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of
independent candidates in the whitesonly election on May 6,
they added.
    It has risen about two cents this week alone.
    "Another factor is that banks in London, where the main
market is based, are going long in the currency because of a
general feeling that it will rise in the future," one economist
said.
    Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that
was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation
phase from recent gains.
    After reaching 30 cents, "There is a chance of appreciation
to 32 cents in the next several weeks," one dealer said.
    There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial
rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were
staying firm, banking sources said.
    A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be
identified said "The rise of the independents appears to be
indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party
and has created a favourable sentiment overseas."
    One dealer said growing business and investor interest from
West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rands
rise.
    Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by
South Africas longterm government bonds and "semigilts" or
securities in partly governmentowned firms, many with yields
as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands
with interest paid in commercial rands.
    "This has had a definite influence on the financial form of
the rand," a dealer said, adding that at present demand is
slightly in excess of supply.
    The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to
help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of
severe political unrest in the country.

<TITLE>GERMAN INVESTORS SLOW TO ACCEPT BOND INNOVATIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By FranzJosef Ebel, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WEST BERLIN, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The liberalization of West German
capital markets in May 1985 led to a flood of financial
innovations but the lack of a secondary market for these has
diminished their acceptance, Deutsche Girozentrale  Deutsche
Kommunalbank management board member Wiegand Hennicke said.
    While innovations may be intellectualy stimulating, they
lack transparency, he told an investors forum in West Berlin.
    "Properly functioning markets require standardized products.
This condition has not been met by some of the innovations,"
Hennicke said.
    The volume of zero coupon bonds and floating rate notes,
the most widely used financial innovations in Germany, stands
at four billion and 16 billion marks, respectively, a tiny
proportion of the 1,000 billion marks of bonds in circulation.
    Even for zerocoupon bonds and floating rate notes, a
secondary market had not developed, Hennicke said. One
important reason for this was the bourse turnover tax, which
was reducing the rate of return to the investors.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said this
week he believed the tax could still be removed, even if its
abolition was not decided during recent coalition discussions.
    KarlHerbert SchneiderGaedicke, deputy management board
chairman of DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, said German
domestic and institutional investors had also shown
reservations about investing in participation shares.
    One of the reasons was the widely varying terms and
conditions of participation shares in West Germany. "The
investor has to scrutinize participation shares carefully,
before making an investment decision," SchneiderGaedicke said.
    He added the attractiveness of participation shares could
be increased by limiting the combination possibilities of terms
and conditions and increasing safeguards for investors.
    He also urged publicizing the comparative advantage of
participation shares over ordinary shares for foreigners.
    Foreigners do not receive the corporation tax bonus granted
to domestic investors for share dividends.
    Karl Thomas, head of the Bundesbanks credit department,
said the domestic investor had missed earnings opportunities
over the last four years by failing to invest in German bonds.
    Domestic investors did not believe interest rates would
decline and stay at low levels for such a long time, because
expectations were determined by sharp interest rate
fluctuations at the start of the decade.
    The Bundesbank has a natural interest in seeing domestic
savings channelled into bonds and shares, Thomas said.
    A shift of savings into longterm assets would dampen
monetary expansion and foster a stable rise of the money
supply, he said.

<TITLE>CBT HEAD CONFIDENT OF SEPARATE CBT, MCE LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Board of Trade, CBT,
President Thomas Donovan said he was confident the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, would not force the CBT and
the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, MCE, to merge speculative
position limits on futures contracts traded on the two
exchanges.
    Last month CFTC proposed combining CBT and MCE contracts on
corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and oats for the purposes
of applying speculative position limits.
    Donovan told Reuters he had spoken to CFTC officials about
the matter and believed they would modify the proposal.
    CBT officials have complained the CFTC was reneging on a
commitment made when the two exchanges formed an affiliation,
and proposing to decrease spot month limits on the MCE contrary
to congressional intent.

<TITLE>SWISSAIR PLANE ORDER FOR 1.2 BILLION SWISS FRANCS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair ltSWSZ.Z> said that the order
for McDonnell Douglas Corp ltMD> MD11 long haul jets confirmed
this morning was worth a total 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
    President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had not
yet been decided whether the planes would have General Electric
Co ltGE.N>, Pratt and Whitney ltUTX> or Rolls Royce engines.
    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than the
rival A340 of the European Airbus consortium because it met
better the Swissair requirements and would be able to enter
service in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC10s it
replaces.
    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its whole
fleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order of
five more longhaul planes in addition to the six announced
today. He said it would decide on the basis of the development
of traffic whether these five would be MD11s or Boeing 747s.
    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissair
might eventually choose A340s. "We cannot afford to operate
three different types of aircraft," he said.
    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise its
option to buy Airbus A310s, of which it already operates nine,
officials said. But it would still hold the options open.
    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of the
MD11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for the
planes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.
    Company officials said that Swissair intended to cover
around 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC10 replacement
programme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raise
the remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital markets
through issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or through
a capital increase.
    The first such bond issue would likely come this year, they
predicted.

<TITLE>BP SALE WAS IN UK 1987/88 BUDGET MATHS  TREASURY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Treasury said its 1987/88
budget arithmetic which was unveiled on Tuesday "took full
account of likely proceeds" from the sale of the governments
remaining 31.7 pct stake in British Petroleum Co PLC BP.L.
    A statement issued by the Treasury said "the BP announcement
therefore makes no difference to our estimate of privatisation
proceeds in 1987/88, or to subsequent years, which remains 5.0
billion stg a year."
    "It makes no difference to the PSBR Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement which the Chancellor set in the budget," it said.
    "It has nothing to do with the future scope for tax cuts."
    The Treasurys move was prompted by press speculation,
officials said, which followed last nights surprise
announcement by the government. It currently holds about 578.5
mln shares in BP.
    The Treasury statement said that the selloff "is simply a
part of the governments continuing privatisation programme,
the overall size of which was announced in the Autumn
economic Statement" last November.
    It said the BP proceeds "will be received in installments,
of which the first will be in 1987/88."
    News of the privatisation weighed down both BPs share
price in London and the equity market overall, market sources
said.
    The prospect of so much more BP paper in circulation had
cut BP shares at 1340 GMT to 824 pence from yesterdays London
close of 828 pence. The companys shares had been down as low
as 802 pence before rebounding, stock market sources said.
    Worries over the ability of the London stock market to
digest the BP and other privatisation issues sent the Financial
Times/Stock Exchange 100 Share Index down 9.1 points by 1340
GMT to 1997.5 from last nights close. At one point the index
was as low as 1989.1, the sources said.

<TITLE>TRANSAMERICA ltTA> TO HAVE GAIN ON UNIT SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, MArch 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Transamerica Corp said it expects
to realize a gain of about 75 mln dlrs on the
previouslyannounced sale of the group life and health
operations of its Transamerican Occidental Life Insurance Co
subsidiary to Provident Life and Accident Co ltPACC>.
    But it said its Transamerica Life Cos unit plans to change
to a more conservative method of amortizing deferred policy
acquisition costs, resulting in a onetime charge that will
offset most of the gain from the sale.
    Transamerica said it has now signed a definitive agreement
for the sale, which will be structured as a reinsurance
transaction involving about 400 mln dlrs of reserve
liabilities.
    It said the 75 mln dlr gain from the sale and about 125 mln
dlrs of statutory surplus that previously supported operations
of the group being sold will be used to support Transamerica
Life Cos efforts to accelerate the growth of its remaining
businesses.  It said closing is expected by May One, subject to
regulatory approvals.

<TITLE>OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The results of a controversial study
of farm subsidies conducted by the Parisbased Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the
highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy
farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from
subsidies.
    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD
because of objections from some countries, were provided to
Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not
be identified.
    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for
the years 197981 using a new measure called the producer
subsidy equivalent, PSE.
    The study shows that on dairy products Japans PSE, or the
amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged
83.3 pct over 197981, with the European Community at 68.8 pct
and the United States 48.2 pct.
    For wheat Japans PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and
the U.S. 17.2. Japans rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC
13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.
    In coarse grains, Japans subsidies reached 107.1 pct
compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.
Japans beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC
and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.
    For sugar, Japans PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the
EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.
    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial
countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most
cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and
Japan, the sources said.
    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing
country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD
work.
    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to
release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD
ministerial meeting in Paris during May.
    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a 
basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade
talks now underway in Geneva.
    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit
to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting
point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.
    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate
down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of
the present crisis in world agriculture.
    However, the OECD study results are controversial because
they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials
familiar with the study said.
    The U.S. Agriculture Departments Economic Research Service
recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to
verify the OECD results and update them to 198284.
    In some cases the results were substantially different than
the OECDs, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and
elsewhere had changed markedly by 198284 from the OECD base
period of 197981, U.S. officials said.
    For example, the USDA study found the United States
subsidies to corn producers were higher in 198284, at 25 to 49
pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.
    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,
citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told
reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its
farmers more than the EC.
    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably
higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.
    Officials of several countries have been asked to
contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to
1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the
current world farm situation.
    The updated calculations, which may take several months to
complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.
subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive
import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.
    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm
bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to
grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials
added.

<TITLE>SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair ltSWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct
drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,
in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut
its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.
    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the
first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would
at least equal last years figure, but said much depended on
outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.
    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on
Swissairs core flying business last year, against a profit of
27 mln francs the previous year, he said.
    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68
mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs
in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20
mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on
the speed with which it decided to sell its DC10s.
    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276
mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.
    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln
francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45
mln francs supplementary depreciation.
    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made
this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate
fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.
    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in
the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel
prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc
against other European currencies.
    "Income and profit generated by services to these countries
shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate
trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other
airlines."

<TITLE>COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa
buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.
    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the
opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa
market support mechanism were improving.
    "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock
rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer
spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.
    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the
negotiations "optimistic and realistic."
    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when
a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,
with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions
on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about
100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250
mln dlrs.
    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at
this semiannual council meeting in order to stop the slide in
world cocoa prices.
    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles
as a basis for negotiations.
    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A
working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle
the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO
executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshedout version
of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates
said.
    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication
of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are
elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet
separately later today to examine the scheme.
    The draft proposal included three principles a limit to
non member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system
for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be
paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates
said.
    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast
delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to
work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into
effect as soon as possible, Baron said.
    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of
the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday
to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry
of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.
    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council
session because of a conflicting International Sugar
Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,
delegates said.

<TITLE>IOMEGA CORP ltIOMG> EXPECTS QTR AND YEAR LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROY, Utah, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Iomega Corp announced it expected
revenues for the first quarter of 1987 to be significantly
lower than planned and that it anticipated a loss for the
quarter.
    In its annual report to be mailed to stockholders tomorrow,
the company will announce its first quarter loss will be in
excess of 10 mln dlrs primarily as a result of lower than
anticipated revenues.
    The company said it recored net income of 4,572,000 dlrs,
or 30 cts per share, for its first quarter fiscal 1986, on
revenues of 35.0 mln.
    The company said it lowered its revenue plan for the
balance of 1987 and also expects to record a loss for the
entire 1987 year.
    Iomega said the first quarter loss will place the company
in default under certain covenants in its bank line of credit
unless these covenants are modified.
    The company is currently exploring alternatives for raising
additional funds through a debt for equity financing.

<TITLE>PORSCHE HALFYEAR EARNINGS CALLED SATISFACTORY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG ltPSHG.F>
said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory"
despite burdens caused by the dollars weakness against the
mark and stagnating domestic demand.
    In its semiannual shareholders report, Porsche said first
half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83
billion in the same period of 1985/86.
    However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without
giving absolute figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380
mln.
    Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
billion in the first half of last year, although the export
quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
    The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of
turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.
    Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.
Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122
from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
the report said.
    Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the
comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued
for all models but demand fell in other markets.
    Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
    Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
    Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
    Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
year at a "high level," Porsche said.

<TITLE>NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Nordberg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A new market has emerged in warrants to
buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play
of commodity options into the field of securities.
    Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks
have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying
conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the
recovery of the gold price last year.
    And Credit Suisse and Credit SuisseFirst Boston each
issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a
similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional
market.
    The market is still small. Taken together, the four
Americanled warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss
francs.
    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and
predicted a lively future.
    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland AG
said "The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a
longterm investment in gold with limited risk."
    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on
February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a
week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.
    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich
organized and coled an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque
Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty
Switzerland AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of
New York.
    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for
gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the
same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on
the first one for Citibank.
    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities
from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases
longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.
    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to
the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a
jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.
    "Many people are worried about inflation again," said Mats
Joensson of Goldman Sachs. "Money supply in Germany and the
United States has grown very strongly in the last year and
people want to take a ride on gold."
    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has
languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few
weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more
highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.
    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in
Switzerland. "People here understand gold, and they understand
warrants," he said.
    Citicorp Switzerland pioneered warrants with a series of
equitylinked covered issues based on Japanese company shares
over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched
covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give
foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed
to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.
    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up
when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.
    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple
premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide
scientific comparisons between titles in the options market.
    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his banks issue was
competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for
five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making
a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.
    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issues
long, 4.3year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit
volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,
which he claimed was lower than the other issues.
    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used
pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and
emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.
    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit
volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.
    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm
welcome from investors.
    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,
even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants
apiece. "The most sophisticated ones wouldnt buy these because
the premiums are too high," he said.

<TITLE>JEFFERIES ltJEFG> CHAIRMAN PLEADING GUILTY, QUITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Jefferies Group Inc said founder
and chairman Boyd L. Jefferies has resigned and intends to
plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal
securities laws.
    The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the company
ever engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the company
ever sought or communicated insider information or violated ny
trust of confidence placed in them by customers.  It said no
governmental authority has ever alleged any such activity on
Boyd Jefferies part or the part of the company.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies has consented to an
administrative order barring him from the securities business
for at least five years and he has agreed to place his 13 pct
holding in Jefferies Group stock in a voting trust during that
period.
    The company said, without admitting any allegations made by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boyd Jefferies,
Jefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies and
Co also consented to an injunction barring any future
securities laws violations.
    It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertake
reviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and other
control systems are in compliance with federal laws.
    The company said president and chief operating officer
Frank E. Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executive
officer.  Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive.
    The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferies
resulted from a transaction in which, on behalf of Jefferies
and Co, he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlled
by Ivan F. Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boesky
firms.
    It said "Within days of the purchase, the market value of
one of the stocks fell sharply and, pursuant to their
agreement, a Boesky entity paid Jefferies and Co three mln dlrs
to offset the loss.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that following
the loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mln
dlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services,
although Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as an
offset to the losses it experienced.
    It said by rendering the involice, Boyd Jefferies
apparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a false
entry in its books, resulting in the charge, to which Boyd
Jefferies will plead guilty, of aiding and abetting one of the
Boesky firms in making false entries on its books.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies will also plead guilty to a
margin violation resulting from a transaction in which he
caused Jefferies and Co to buy shares at the request of a
customer in the companys trading account.
    It was expected that the customer would be responsible for
any loss on the shares and would also receive any profit, and
because the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase,
Boyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to finance
the full purchase price for the shares in violation of margin
requirements, the company said.
    The company quoted Boyd Jefferies as saying, "I fully
accept sole responsibility for these transactions.  I think it
is appropriate that I suffer the consequences for my actions
rather than the company."
    Jefferies Group said it expects no impact on its operations
or client base from Boyd Jefferies departure.

<TITLE>EC APPROVES 680 MLN STG U.K. AID TO ROVER GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community EC Commission
said it approved a 680 mln stg British government aid package
to stateowned Rover Group Plc ltBLLL.L> to restructure and
privatise the groups bus and truck subsidiaries.
    In a statement, the commission said Rovers ltLeyland
Trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically
restructured following a recently announced merger between
Leyland Trucks and ltDAF> of the Netherlands.
    The Commission said government aid for this program was
justified because it would contribute to Europewide
rationalisation of the truck sector.
    The amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln
stg the British government had planned to grant Rover by
writing off accumulated losses and other costs.
    The Commission said there was overcapacity in the European
truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct.
    It said its approval of the aid also took into account the
consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the
restructuring.
    Under EC rules, the Commission has to approve all
government aid to industry.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OILTAX CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance
to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to
spur domestic production.
    The White House has said it would consider the option
although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new
tax code.
    Herrington told a meeting of the MidContinent Oil and Gas
Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and
enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a
year.
    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and
the national security the Energy Department sent to the White
House on Tuesday.
    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance
option "that is one that could significantly increase
production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."
    He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to
the overall U.S. economy.

<TITLE>U.S. PERSONAL INCOME ROSE 0.9 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. personal income rose 0.9 pct,
or 32.4 billion dlrs, in February to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 3,581.3 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department
said.
    The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personal
income during January. Earlier, the department estimated
January personal income was unchanged.
    The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase
since a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. It
attributed last months rise to several factors, including
subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises.
    The department said personal consumption expenditures were
up during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9
billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct in
January.
    Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs last
month after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January with
sales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February
increase and the January decline, the department said.
    Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in February
after a 300 mln dlr increase in January.
    The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were
up 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr rise
in January.
    Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs last
month after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gains
widespread through durable and nondurable industries, the
department said.
    Farmers incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in February
after declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both last
months increase and Januarys fall in farm incomes was because
of government subsidy payments, the department said.
    Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs in
February following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The 
declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a
month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal
nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.
    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up
1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after
rising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.
    The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February from
four pct in January, the department said.

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986/87 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Babcock AG
ltDBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year
ending September 9 although the earnings level is still
unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said.
    He told a news conference that business during the year had
weakened somewhat but was still generally positive.
    Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26
billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.
However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately
unchanged from the previous years 5.14 billion marks when
current orders from major projects are booked.
    Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end
February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion
for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct
increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.
    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at
8.64 billion marks.
    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct
yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits
totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the
previous years 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.
    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.
    Wiehn said Babcocks liquidity had clearly improved in the
current business year, with financial reserves in the first
five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing
by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.
    He said pretax earnings per share for 1985/86, according
to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and
earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.
    The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at
three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference
shares.

<TITLE>SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Colin Brinsden, Reuters.</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Current interest by Soviet charterers in
taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To
carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent
surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures
Exchange BIFFEX, dealers said.
    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for
the first time in the spot position since the market opened in
May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values
some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is
calculated on spot physical rates.
    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but
they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage about
50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf which would
normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.
    "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect
on its the Soviet grain harvest than reported," one said.
    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have
subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering
conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for
the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen
steadily for vessels loading next month.
    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering
taking older vessels out of layup to meet current demand.
    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese
operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business
later in the year, they said.
    They anticipate this would appear around June and it has
prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it
normally being a slack time in the shipping year.
    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates
turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had
supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but
then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.

<TITLE>TURKISH DEBT REACHED 31.4 BILLION DLRS AT END1986</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Bolding, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Turkeys external debt rose to the
equivalent of 31.4 billion dlrs at end1986 from 25.4 billion a
year earlier, Treasury Undersecretary Yavuz Canevi said.
    Canevi, who gave the figure at a briefing on the Turkish
economy arranged for Ankarabased diplomats, said the
shortterm component was 9.6 billion dlrs at end1986, up from
6.6 billion.
    Much of Turkeys debt is denominated in currencies other
than the dollar. Canevi said the increase expressed in dollar
terms was partly attributable to the fall in value of the U.S.
Currency.
    While the rise in total debt was about 24 pct in dollar
terms, it would be only 11 pct if expressed in special drawing
rights and would represent a fall of 11 pct if expressed in the
West German mark, he said.
    On the rise in shortterm debt, Canevi said half the amount
was in Turkish citizens foreign exchange deposits. "On a macro
level it is a liability but it is not really a liability
because it will be repaid in Turkish lira," he added.
    Canevi was Governor of the Turkish Central Bank until last
November, when he was promoted to Undersecretary for the
Treasury and Foreign Trade, a key economic management post.
    Canevi listed what he called the assets of the Turkish
economy, including liberalisation in the last three years, the
countrys geographical position and the strength of its
agriculture and manpower skills.
    The debt picture was one of three liabilities, he said,
along with the failure to reduce inflation swiftly and
impatience. "We are an impatient nation ... We should be patient
enough to achieve better results," he added.
    Wholesale prices on an index issued by Canevis department
rose 27.4 pct in the year to February, compared with 33.3 pct a
year earlier.
    On inflation, Canevi said "We have chosen to reduce
inflation in a moderate way. We could have reduced it in two
years from 25 pct to five pct but we needed growth ... We
already have high unemployment."
    "I dont blame people who are sick and tired of living with
inflation but it was 100 per cent before. The trend is down, so
lets be patient and not distort overall policies and we will
achieve our targets in one or two years," he said.

<TITLE>CONTROL RESOURCE ltCRIX> SEES LOWER EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MICHIGAN CITY, Ind., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Control Resource
Industries Inc said the company estimates 1986 earnings to be
between 800,000 and 900,000 dlrs, or 22 to 25 cts per share,
compared with 852,000 dlrs, or 33 cts per share, during 1985.
    The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is
24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.
    The estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares
outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985.
    R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986
was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins
at the companys Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an
increase in bad debt reserves.
    Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.
Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which
were not adequate at the time of acquisition.
    He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second
and fourth quarters.
    Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will
be restated, though final net income for the year will remain
in the estimated range.
    He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987
revenues were favorable.

20dayold national seamens strike, which has seriously

<DATELINE>    COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Growth Ventures Inc
said it is discontinuing its participation in a Mexican joint
venture formed to make flexible diskettes and is liquidating
its whollyowned Rock Hohl Interiors Inc subsidiary in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
    The company said the resulting losses, lack of assets and
negative net worth will in all likelihood make it impossible
for Groweth Ventures to continue operating.
    The company said it is ending its participation in the
Mexican venture due to continuing delays in obtaining
sufficient working capital funding from governmentcontrolled
banks in Mexico.  The funding is needed not only for joint
venture operations but also for the payment on debentures to
Growth Ventures from the joint venture, it said.
    It said since payment on the debentures has not been made,
it does not have sufficient capital to support the continuing
operations of Rick Hohl Interiors, and it will liquidate Rick
Hohl.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia will not attend a meeting of
coffee producing countries scheduled for this weekend in
Nicaragua, Jorge Cadenas, manager of the National Coffee
Growers Federation, said.
    "We prefer to wait until things are better prepared," he told
Reuters. He added the meeting could be postponed.
    Colombia, Brazil and the Central American coffee producing
countries were invited to the meeting in Managua to analyze the
market situation
    However, he did not dismiss the idea of dialogue and
negotiation in preparation for meetings of the International
Coffee Organization.
    Gilberto Arango, president of Colombias exporters
association, speaking to Reuters earlier this week, ruled out a
fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers
had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from
continuous contacts.
    The International Coffee Organization executive board is to

<TITLE>SOVIET FIRM SAYS TALKS ON FOR PHILIPPINE MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Preliminary talks are on between two
stateowned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and
equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc
Mining and Industrial Corp NMIC which operates the
Philippines only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said.
    G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet
embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that
Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether
it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect.
    "It is the other way round," Valentchits said.
    He said the Development Bank of the Philippines DBP and
the Philippine National Bank PNB, which own NMIC, had
approached the Soviet stateowned firm in August last year.
    "We studied the question and asked the banks in which field
and what area they can help in the project," Valentchits said.
    He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks
were "only just initial."
    NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials
were not available for comment.
    Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at
NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks
foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial
Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation.
    The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for placing the
company under receivership and the suspension of its debt
payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure.
    Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to
NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the lead
agent.
    The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed
by Citicorp.
    It said the governments privatisation program has listed
NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign
investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm.
    The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of
at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for
foreclosures from major creditors.
    The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets
totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with
the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos.
    NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines
since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of
salaries delayed because of the firms financial difficulties.
    The firm produced 1,863 tonnes of nickel in the first two
months of 1986, compared with 2,364 tonnes in the same period
in 1985. The mines capacity is 2,000 tonnes a month.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and
Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and
currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,
economists said.
    "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in
1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be
screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve
Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.
after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.
    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,
the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric
against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their
currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.
    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized
countries NICs amid signs the dollars steep drop against the
currencies of Japan and most EC nations  previously the main
focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap  is beginning to
close the competiveness gap for American goods.
    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he
expects a reduction in Japans trade surplus this year.
    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their
own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not
risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries
of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and
Korean exporters are wellplaced to take up the slack.
    "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was
Japanbashing. Now its NICbashing," said Robert Chandross, of
Lloyds Bank PLC.
    Asias four main NICs  Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore
and Taiwan  accounted for almost onefifth of the overall 170
billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.
    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in
1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade
deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.
    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is
continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6
billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The
gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.
    Lately both nations have said they will take steps to
defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many
of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import
tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.
    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last
week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to
five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut
tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and
try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang
ChienShien said last month that he still does not expect
Taiwans trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.
    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles
and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the
area of "bigticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.
    Korea expects its auto exports  mostly for North America
 to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.
    "The NICs exports are almost all manufactured goods. When
their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing
base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob
Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.
    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Koreas computer products exports,
72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its
telecommunications equipment.
    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and
South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.
    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the
U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.
    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in
marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into
large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade
and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.
    Morgan expects Taiwans overall trade surplus to grow to
18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and
Koreas to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.
    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.
    "A lot of Korea and Taiwans exports to the U.S. have been
at Japans expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.
    Februarys Paris meeting of six major industrial powers
exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.
    But this twopronged approach has drawn little response
from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work
with a sizeable lag, economists say.
    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwans and
Koreas currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is
pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since
September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.
    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against
the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.
    "Weve not seen any lessening of competition from those
countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said
Bethlehem Steels Wendt.
    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their
hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.
    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will
get given the administrations freetrade stance. "Its hard to
see that anything will be passed much before yearend. And then
the question is, will it have teeth" one economist said.

<TITLE>MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANTANANARIVO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Madagascars available coffee
output is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from
82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural
services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas,
Agriculture Ministry sources said.
    This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to
20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,
they said.
    The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,
but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last
year from 41,662 in 1985.
    Low yields from the countrys ageing coffee plantations and
prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also
contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.
    They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascars coffee bushes
were planted before 1930.
    The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from
reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and
the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the governments
19861990 fiveyear plan.
    In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the
government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with
highyielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources
said.
    The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at
producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low
caffeine content.
    The sources added that Madagascars plan to export roasted
coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only
650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year.

<TITLE>PHILIPS MEDICAL SETS RESEARCH PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SHELTON, Conn., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Philips Medical Systems Inc, a
unit of North American Philips Corp, said a research program
is underway at seven medical centers aimed at producing a new
standard of threedimensional medical imaging systems.
    The goal is to provide doctors with quicker and better
diagnostic information about human organs. Current systems have
limited functions and can examine body parts such as limbs or
the skull but not functioning organs, according to a Philips
Medical spokesman.
    The twoyear program involves equipment from Philips and
three private companies Cemax Inc, a Santa Clara, Calif.,
maker of threedimensional computer graphics systems, Island
Graphics Corp, a San Rafael, Calif., graphics software firm,
and Pixar, also a San Rafael software concern.
    Philips holds about 10 pct each of Cemax and Island
Graphics, the spokesman said, and is the exclusive worldwide
distributor of Cemaxs 1500X computer graphics system.
    Philips also has an original equipment manufacturer
agreement with Pixar.
    The institutions are Duke University Medical Center in
Durham, N.C., Emory University, Atlanta, Johns Hopkins Medical
Institution, Baltimore, Washington University Medical Center,
St Louis, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., UCLA, Los Angeles, and
the University of Alabama, Birmingham.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY RULES OUT GASOLINE TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help
avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased
reliance on foreign oil in the coming years.
    He said at a news conference that any recommendation he
would make would have to increase domestic production, not
cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to
the U.S. taxpayer.
    On the grounds of increasing production, he said, "I would
rule out a gasoline tax."
    Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import
fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause  the
loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices
and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion
dlrs.
    He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on
new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a
cheap way to spur domestic production.
    He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.
    Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to
the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.
    The White House said it would study the proposal, but was
generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just
passed last year.
    Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction,
said, "If I were the White House, I would be cool, too."

<TITLE>WIND DAMAGES CONTINUES IN GREAT PLAINSUSDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Land damaged by wind in the 10state
Great Plains amount to nearly 3.7 mln acres so far this year,
onethird more than the 197084 average and 300,000 acres more
than the amount reported at this time last year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In addition to the land reported damaged, another 15 mln
acres are unprotected and susceptible to wind damage, 34 pct
more than the 197084 average, but about one mln acres less
than last year.
    The states hardest hit were in the Northern Plains, where
wind damaged 2.4 mln acres, an increase of 1.5 mln acres over
the amount reported a year ago, the department said.
    Suffering the most damage in the Northern Plains were
Montana 1.3 mln acres, and North Dakota 518,500 acres.
    Of the five Southern Plains states, only Colorado reported
an increase in winddamaged land over last year, it said.
    Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas reported a reduction
in damaged land, due in part to emergency conservation tillage
practices and in part to rainfall and weather conditions.
    Of the land damaged, 96.2 pct was cropland, 3.5 pct
rangeland, and 0.9 pct was other land.
    Inadequate snow cover and high winds, coupled with a lack
of erosion control practices such as windbreaks and
conservation tillage, contributed to the increased wind damaged
land in some areas, the department said.
    Data on wind damage is collected during NovemberJune.

<TITLE>USDA ASKS TIGHT INSECT RULES FOR GRAIN SHIPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is
proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on
insect infestations in grain shipments.
    The changes in the standards would include the following
     Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live
insects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.
     Revising the definition of "infested" to give equal value
to all insects injurious to grain.
     Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the
infested level would be set at three or more live insects per
representative sample about 100 grams, in 1990 two or more
insects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set
at one or more live insects per representative sample.
     Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a
limit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.
     Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by
adding a limit of 32 insectdamaged kernels per 100 grams of
wheat.
    The department asked for public comments on the proposals
by April 17.

<TITLE>PILLSBURY ltPSY> HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower
earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
declines.
    Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
rose four pct.
    It said Burger King USA and Bennigans reported higher
operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
which introduced a new menu.
    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
Kings distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
on developing concepts  QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
 hurt results.
    It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
quarter.
    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
retirement program initiated a year ago.
    Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
1.46 billion dlrs.
    Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced pershare earnings by nine
cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
    As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax
rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5
percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>European Community EC industry
ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of
closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12country
bloc into reasonable balance with demand.
    The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary
plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer
which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.
    Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the
scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for
discussion, but did not go nearly far enough.
    Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of
plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,
provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC
or national governments for redundancy and other social costs.
    But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry
Commissioner KarlHeinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln
tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should
be closed by the end of 1990.
    He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint
the scope for closure in heavy hotrolled widestrip products,
typically produced in plants employing thousands of people.
    The sources said no minister challenged Narjes analysis
that four or five hotrolled widestrip lines would have to
close.
    They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be
expanded and developed through meetings among the industry
body, the Commission and representatives of member states.
    However, diplomats said it was clear from todays
discussions that such meetings will be difficult.
    They said member states are split on whether to reduce the
scope of a quota production system, which at present protects
EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of
their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.
    It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which
EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on
how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should
come from Community coffers.
    German minister Martin Bangemann said his countrys steel
industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer
proportionately more than others, German sources said.
    But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,
insists that the profitability of companies should be taken
into account.
    The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from
massive recent writeoffs of its accumulated debts, is
currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black.
    Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint
statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the
industry.

<TITLE>REPLIGEN ltRGEN> TO SEEK AIDS VACCINE TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Repligen Corp said it intends
to file an investigational new drug application to the Food and
Drug Administration seeking permission to test its AIDS vaccine
in humans by the early summer.
    Repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of the
year.
    "We are sufficiently encouraged and impressed by the work
to date to go ahead with a clinical trial," said Michael Egan,
manager of business development for Repligen, a biotechnology
company.
    Repligens Egan said the vaccine contains a subfragment of
the protein coat of the AIDS virus. In animal tests, which
included primates, Egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizing
antibodies to the AIDS virus and broader cellular immunity.
    Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver its
vaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer than
vaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found on
the surface coat of the AIDS virus.
    Yesterday, BristolMyers Co ltBMY> said it would seek
regulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine, which uses a
smallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.
    Repligens AIDS vaccine is a collaborative effort of the
company, Centocor Inc ltCNTO>, Duke University Medical School
and the National Cancer Insitutes. The research teams are
directed by John Ghrayeb of Centocor, Scott Putney of Repligen,
Dani Bolognesi at Duke and Robert Gallo and Flossie WongStaal
at the National Cancer Institute.
    Although there are several AIDS vaccine candidates, experts
believe that development of a safe and effective vaccine is a
long ways away. Moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine is
only the first step in a long process of verifying if the
vaccine actually will prevent infection.

introduced two new products, one of which allows its private
automatic computer exchange networking systems to connect
directly to Digital Equipment Corp ltDEC>s Unibusequipped
computers.
    The company said its new VGS 2518 communications gateway
server provides a high capacity pathway for high speed
asynchronous data transfer between Unibus systems and Gandalfs
PACX 200 and PACX 2000 systems. Gandalf said it is the first in
a series of high bandwidth gateway servers it plans to
introduce this year.
    Gandalf said its other new product is the MUX 2000
multiplexing system, which offers a mix of voice and data
capabilities and allows users to select from among four Gandalf
multiplexing elements.
    The company said this flexibility will be attractive to
large users. "The larger the network, the more likely that
flexible multiplexing solutions are required," a Gandalf

    Snowpack and precipitation were well below normal
throughout much of the West as of last week.
    Eight of the 12 states in which the department collects
data reported snowpack and precipitation at threequarters or
less of normal.
    It said unless late winter snows or spring rains bring
relief, these states can expect possible water shortages this
summer.
    Major water users, including agricultural producers,
municipalities and industry, should begin conservation measures
now to avoid water rationing later, USDA said.
    The department said California, one of the countrys major
agricultural producers, is the driest, with snowpack and
precipitation so far this year at less than half of normal.
    Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and
Washington also report significant shortages despite pockets of
near normal to above noral rainfall in some areas, the
department said.
    Arizona and Alaska have higher than normal snowpack and
precipitation, while Colorado and New Mexico are near normal,
it said.
    The western water supply forecast is based on the latest
snow surveys and analyses of precipitation data by the
department and the National Weather Service.

<TITLE>BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Britoil Plcs ltBTOL.L> exploration
expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a
third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would
remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker
said.
    He told reporters following the release of the companys
1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
levels.
    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
1985.
    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
charge of 50 mln stg on the companys U.S. Assets. The results
were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
firmed to 231p from 222p at last nights close. Chairman Sir
Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
come through remarkably well.
    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
conditions would be right for a substantially improved
performance this year.
    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
they were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about the
prospects for future levels.
    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
latter part of April.
    Endyear reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
included a revised definition of reserves.
    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
previously.
    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
restated 3,660 billion.

<TITLE>GTE ltGTE> SELLS DEBENTURES YIELDING 8.737 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>GTE Corp is raising 250 mln dlrs
through an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.737 pct,
said sole underwriter UBS Securities Inc.
    UBS, the U.S. unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, won the
issue in competitive bidding against syndicates led by such
major U.S. houses as First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
    UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issue
in the domestic debt market this year, following Daiwa
Securities America Inc. However, investment bankers noted that
UBS was the first foreigner to break into the U.S. market when
it won a competitive bidding in June 1986.
    An officer on UBSs corporate syndicate desk said the GTE
issue is the fourth that the securities firm has managed.
    UBS bid the GTE debentures at 97.0025 and set a coupon of
81/2 pct and reoffering price of 97.50 to yield 112 basis
points over the offtherun 91/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Nonrefundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A3 by
Moodys and Aminus by Standard and Poors.
    GTE last tapped the debt market when it sold on November
20, 1986, 250 mln dlrs of samematurity, samerated debt priced
to yield 9.388 pct, or 174 basis points over comparable
Treasury paper, underwriters noted.
    Underwriters said that two of the UBSlead offerings were
negotiated deals. UBS won the other two issues in competitive
bidding acting as sole underwriter.
    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,
ran the books for a March 11 offering of 200 mln dlrs of
10year notes of Rockwell International Corp ltROK>,
underwriters noted.
    Thus far, Nomura Securities International Inc is the only
other foreign firm to manage a U.S. debt offering. The U.S.
unit of Nomura Securities Co Ltd of Japan, acting as sole
underwriter, won a competitive issue in early December 1986.

release the first of its Retail Price Index RPI figures
calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on
January 1987, as previously announced, the Employment
Department said.
    The index, Britains measure of inflation, is for February.
Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent
figures including the new components, a spokesman said.
    Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974.
    Market forecasts centre on a 0.40.5 pct monthly rise in
February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct. The government
forecasts annual inflation will be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987.

<TITLE>NEW NYMEX CHAIRMAN BRADT SETS MERGER PRIORITIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>William Bradt, new chairman of the New
York Mercantile Exchange, NYMEX, said his priorities are to
merge the exchange with other futures exchanges at the World
Trade Center and to reallocate space on the crowded NYMEX
floor.
    Bradt, a local trader and member of the board of governors,
assumed his duties yesterday and met reporters.
    "If all four exchanges become one, we would save incredible
costs and become more competitive to Chicago," Bradt told
Reuters.
    Bradt was referring to a merger among the four exchanges at
the Commodity Exchange Center, an idea that has been discussed
intermittently for several years.
    The four exchanges  the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the New York Cotton Exchange in
addition to the NYMEX  are all located on a single floor at
the World Trade Center.
    Bradt said he would address the problem of space shortages
on the exchange floor by reallocating booth space among the
members, including sharing of booths.
    "If you are a company with potential business for the Merc,
you should get a booth," he said, adding that an exchange
committee is studying the problem.
    The election of Bradt, and of local trader Vincent Viola as
an atlarge member, increases representation of locals on the
15 member board to five members from four, according to a NYMEX
spokesman.
    Bradt defeated vice chairman Stanley Meierfeld by a vote of
315 to 217. He will serve a twoyear term and succeeds Michel
Marks, who decided not to seek reelection after serving as
chairman since 1978.
    Zoltan Guttman was elected vice chairman and Thomas McMahon
was elected as trade house representative.
    John Tafaro, owner of Tafaro Brokerage, was reelected as
floor broker representative on the board, and George Gero, a
vice president of PrudentialBache Securities, was reelected as
futures commission merchant representative.

<TITLE>PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Panama Canal toll charges will not rise
in the year to endSeptember 1988, despite last Octobers
landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the
waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.
    He told a press conference that in confirming the
Commissions earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,
he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.
    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in
the current financial year but this could be carried over and
met from next years revenues.
    This years deficit resulted from the landslide which cost
the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included
eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being
spent on earthmoving operations to prevent any further
landslides.
    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and
he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any
threat to the canals water supply in the foreseeable future.
    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard
cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding
that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when
the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

<TITLE>SEC DETAILS CHARGES AGAINST JEFFERIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal regulators said Boyd
Jefferies, who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokerage
firm, took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stock
and in a stock "parking" plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky.
    In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies
agreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a
large chunk of stock being issued in a public offering.
    Under the agreement, the firm, Jefferies and Co, drove the
price of the stock up by oneeighth point by buying four blocks
of the stock at or near the close of trading, the SEC said.
    Jefferies and Cos purchases of the unidentified stock
accounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stock
on that day and were aimed at manipulation, the SEC said.
    The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was
being traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took
place sometime last year when another unidentified company,
which owned a controlling interest in the company, sold several
million shares of the stock in a secondary public offering.
    The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said.
    The person who made the alleged stock manipulation
agreement with Jefferies was also not identified.
    But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a
phony invoice marked for investment banking services for the
exact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the
stock on the open market, the SEC said.
    The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed in
the complaint, was made later by another unidentified person
after Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, the
SEC said. The firm recorded the payment as "other income," it
said.
    William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at the
SEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealing
the identities of other persons and companies involved in the
stock manipulation scheme.
    "We just made a determination that this was the way to go
at this time," McLucas told Reuters.
    The complaint went into far greater detail in its charges
that Jefferies agreed with Boesky to "park" stock at each
others firms. Parking, or warehousing, stock, refers to deals
where stock is held by one person or firm under an arrangement
where it is actually under the control of someone else.
    Under the agreement between Jefferies and Boesky, Jefferies
and Co would hold stock owned by Seemala Corp, one of Boeskys
brokerage firms, for 31 days, after which Seemala would "buy"
the stock back, the SEC said.
    Seemala realized all gains and sustained all losses on the
stock held by Jefferies and Co during the period, agreed to
compensate Jefferies and Co for carrying the stock and to pay
more than twice Jefferies and Cos usual commission, it said.
    Seemala then agreed to hold stock owned by Jefferies and Co
for a month under terms about the same as the deal in which
Seemala agreed to park its stock at Jefferies and Co, it said.
    The agreement, which violated several securities laws,
allowed Seemala to create a false appearance that no longer
held the stock and could meet the SECs net capital
requirements, the SEC said.
    Jefferies wanted Seemala to hold some of its stock, the SEC
said, so that Jefferies and Co could meet its net capital
needs, the agency said.
    On March 12, 1985, Seemala "sold" Jefferies 810,000 shares
oc Cooper Laboratories Inc for 11.7 mln dlrs, 600,000 shares of
Southland Financial Corp for 17.3 mln dlrs and 500,000 shares
of G.D. Searle and Co for 27.1 mln dlrs, it said.
    On March 20, Jefferies and Co "sold" Seemala 185,500 shares
of American Broadcasting Co for 19.6 mln dlrs, 210,000 shares
of Ideal Basic Industries Inc for 2.9 mln dlrs, 300,000 shares
of ITT Corp for 9.8 mln dlrs, 105,000 shares of Phillips
Petroleum Co for 4.0 mln dlrs, 70,000 shares of Pioneer Corp
for 2.1 mln dlrs and 300,000 shares of Texas Oil and Gas Corp
for 5.3 mln dlrs, the SEC said.
    The value of Seemalas stock at the time of the transfers
was 56 mln dlrs, while Jefferies and Cos stock was worth 43
mln dlrs at the time, the SEC said.
    Within a month, Seemala and Jefferies and Co unwound most
of the stock transfers with each others firms, the SEC said.
    But a major hitch developed in the deal when the price of
Searle stock, which Jefferies and Co was holding for Seemala,
dipped sharply, it said.
    On March 26 Seemala "bought" back its Searle stock for 23.4
mln dlrs, resulting in a 3.6 mln dlr loss for Jefferies and Co,
the SEC said. Seemala then allowed Jefferies and Co to "buy"
back some it the stock Seemala was holding for it at a 647,812
dlr gain and Boeskys firms later paid the Jefferies firm three
mln dlrs, which it called "fees," it said.
    Among the violations Jefferies committed in the schemes,
were net capital, record keeping, public disclosure and margin
requirements, the SEC said.
    Under the settlement of the civil SECs charges, which was
announced simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,
Jefferies and his firm did not have to admit or deny guilt.
    But they agreed to a court order barring them from further
securities law violations.
    Jefferies also agreed to get out of the securities business
for at least five years.

<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Bahrainbased ltArabian Investment
Banking Corp Investcorp EC> is raising 60 mln dlrs through a
mediumterm revolving multipurpose facility, arranger and
colead manager ltArab Banking Corp> ABC said.
    ABC said the deal had originally been mandated for 50 mln
dlrs, but a lead management group of six banks, each
underwriting 10 mln dlrs, had been formed prior to general
syndication, which started today.
    Investcorp, set up in 1982, specialises in buying companies
and property in industrialised nations. It then sells shares in
these to investors in the Gulf region.
    ABC said Investcorps facility can be used "alternatively or
simultaneously" through the following facilities
     issue of euronotes and or advances through tender.
     extension of committed advances by the underwriting
banks, a socalled "backstop" facility.
     issue of contingent obligations such as performance
letters of credit, letters of guarantee or the receipt of
quotations for interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
collars from a panel of selected banks.
    ABC said the final option gives Investcorp the right to
request facilities on an uncommitted basis.
    ABC said the facility has a maturity of three years from
signature, with bullet repayment.
    It said the interest margin over London Interbank Offered
Rates LIBOR for the committed advances will be based on the
total utilisation of the facility  17.5 basis points for up to
one third, 20 basis points for up to two thirds and 22.5 points
for an amount above that level.
    Banks are being invited to underwrite the facility at a
flat fee of 0.325 pct for five mln dlrs, 0.275 pct for three to
four mln and 0.25 pct for one to two mln. Syndication runs
until April 8.

<TITLE>MERRILL LYNCH ltMER> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 119  </DATELINE><BODY>Moodys Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded the ratings on six billion dlrs of debt of Merrill
Lynch and Co Inc.
    Cut were the firms senior debt, Eurodebt and senior
guaranteed Eurodebt to A1 from Aa3 and subordinated debt to
A2 from A1.
    Merrills Prime1 commercial paper was not under review.
    Moodys said that while Merrills absolute earnings would
continue to increase, the houses profitability will lag that
of its peers. And Merrills attempts to improve profitability
will be constrained by accelerating competition, Moodys said.
    Moodys also said Merrill Lynch would continue to
aggressively commit its capital to such merchant banking
activities as bridge financing.
    "These activities elevate the risk content of Merrills
balance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibits
the strong internal capital generation which may be necessary
to support business expansion efforts," Moodys said.
    The rating agency noted, however, that Merrills franchise
retains significant value and gives the firm strong proprietary
securities placement power.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIAL PESSIMISTIC ON AID FUNDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary
James Conrow said he was exceedingly pessimistic that 1988
funding for the multilateral development banks, as proposed by
the Reagan administration, will be approved by Congress.
    Speaking to an international development conference, Conrow
said it appears almost certain Congress will opt to cut
spending for international programs before they cut into
domestic programs.
    He said in such an environment "foreign aid will lose and
lose big."
    The administration has proposed development bank funding of
1.8 billion dlrs for fiscal year 1988 and seeks about 290 mln
dlrs in catchup from funding reduced in prior years.

billion francs to 388.68 billion francs at the end of February
from 375.95 billion at the end of January, the Finance Ministry

    It said in a statement the rise was mainly due to inflows

which resulted in an increase of 12.41 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units rose by 25 mln francs

<TITLE>FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>French gross domestic product will grow
by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the
governments forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private
Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le
Developpement des Entreprises IPECODE said.
    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
level of two pct.
    IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production
was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
demand, unleashing higher import demand.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund IMF rose by 298
mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
Special Drawing Rights SDRs due mainly to the repayment of
French debts.
    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
FECOM remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
in 1988, it added.
    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.
    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,
is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE
said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.
    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to
2.5 pct at the end of 1988, "provided that real wage costs
remain within the framework of productivity rises."

U.S. corporate debt offering in September 1986 and followed
that with the March 11 competitive win.
    The only other foreign firm to manage an offering in the
U.S. market is Nomura Securities International Inc, which won
as sole underwriter a competitive issue in December 1986.
    Morgan Stanley said it bid the Columbus and Southern Ohio
mortgage bonds at 99.609 and set a coupon of nine pct and
reoffering price of par to yield 140 basis points over the
offtherun 91/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.
    The American Electric unit last tapped the domestic debt
market on August 21, 1986, when it issued 80 mln dlrs of
samerated 29year debt securities priced to yield 91/2 pct,
or 204 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.
    Nonrefundable for five years, the 30year first mortgage
bonds are rated Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service Inc and BBB
by Standard and Poors Corp.

<TITLE>UAW TO AUTHORIZE STRIKE AT GM ltGM> PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers said it plans
to tell General Motors Corp later today that it will authorize
a strike by its local at GMs truck and bus works in Pontiac,
Mich.
    The union said its letter to GM means the 9,000 workers at
the Pontiac facility will walk out of the plant next week if a
contract dispute is not settled between the two sides.
    The action "triggers an intensive effort to resolve
disputed issues before the letter expires," the UAW said.
    The main unresolved issue is the subcontracting of work by
GM to nonunion workers, the union said in a statement.
    The UAW said its vice president Donald F. Ephlin, head of
the unions General Motors bargaining unit, met with officials
of Local 594 in Pontiac, Mich., this morning to review the
issues involved in the dispute.
    The union said it is "hopeful that a settlement can be
reached before a strike becomes necessary."

    The constitutional attack by Assistant Attorney General

    Bolton told a Senate subcommittee the administration

<TITLE>CME DROPS S AND P 500 FUTURES PRICE LIMIT PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchanges
board of the directors has decided to drop a proposal to place
a limit on daily price movements of its Standard and Poors 500
futures contract, CME President William Brodsky said.
    Brodsky told the Futures Industry Association that the
exchanges board decided Tuesday to withdraw the proposal,
which aimed to quell price volatility in the popular contract.
    He said the proposal to establish a oneyear pilot program
had generated much negative reaction among users of the
contract and that the CFTC "was not comfortable" with the plan.
    "Now, given the CFTCs posture on our filing, we feel the
negatives outweigh the positives," Brodsky said.
    Brodsky said market users were concerned that limits could
"become selffulfilling because they could force sales to
allow users to avoid becoming locked into the market."
    He also said the board was concerned that the oneyear
pilot price limit might become permanent. "Rules when put in
place sometimes dont come off," he said.

<TITLE>U.N. ADVISES MINES TO FIGHT METAL SUBSTITUTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Mining companies may have to
develop specialty metals and metalcontaining products if
plastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroads
in their markets, according to the United Nations.
    In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
world mineral resources, U.N. experts termed conditions in the
nonfuel mineral industry "unlike anything that has been
experienced for the last half century."
    Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded by
diminishing use of the major and base metals and the
development of substitutes in traditional markets, it said.
    The report was prepared for a nineday session next month
of the U.N. committee on natural resources, an organ of the
Economic and Social Council.
    The gap between world productive capacity and demand would
eventually be eliminated by closing mines, the report
predicted.
    "Although for the most part mining companies have been slow
to develop specialty metals and metalcontaining products and
to develop markets for such products, it seems that such
activities will be needed if plastics and other metal
substitutes are not to make further inroads into the
traditional markets for the major and base metals," the experts
said.
    "Integration of metalproducing and manufacturing
enterprises between and among developed economies seems to be a
likely consequence."
    The report noted that, because of low prices, there was
little incentive for new investment in mining except in the
case of gold, which continued to attract investment at current
prices with important increases in production in the past two
years in North America, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Latin
America.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>ltBenetton SpA> of Italy expects to
further diversify into financial services and is weighing 
possible acquisitions, a Benetton spokeswoman here said.
    "We are thinking of diversification outside of the retail
line," the spokeswoman said. "We are looking at financial
services and other manfacturing companies."
    However, she said the company was not targeting the U.S.
for its planned expansion, but was looking at a number of
different countries.
    The companys shares are traded in the U.S. as American
Depository Receipts, which were issued through an offering by
Morgan Stanley Group Inc ltMS> earlier this month.
    Benetton is now holding talks with Wall Street firms about
the possibility of receiving a quotation of its shares on the
New York Stock Exchange. "Theres absolutely no timetable. It
may not even happen," the spokeswoman said.
    She also denied reports that the company was considering an
issue of convertible bonds with warrants in the U.S. "Were not
thinking of issuing bonds," she said.
    In line with its planned Global expansion efforts, Benetton
is also holding talks with the Soviet Union to explore the
possibility of opening up to 150 stores in the country. But the
spokeswoman pointed out that many companies are holding talks
with the Soviets.
    "We are in discussions and are looking forward to some
response," she said. She added the company had no firm
timetable on when a response might be received.

<TITLE>FRENCH MINISTER RENEWS ECONOMIC CONTROVERSY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Leyla Ertugrul, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>French Social Affairs and Labour Minister
Philippe Seguin has renewed a controversy over whether France
is positioning itself for an economic Uturn, saying it was
possible to boost domestic demand without giving rise to
negative economic effects.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chiracs spokesman, Denis Baudouin,
on Monday sparked speculation of a reflation hitherto excluded
by the government when he said ministers were agreed on the
desirability of "relaunching the economy." 
    The Finance Ministry, however, swiftly ruled out the option
of reinflation policies to boost domestic demand, which were
tried and abandoned by the previous Socialist government.
    Earlier today sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur reiterated policy remained one of restoring sound
finances and enhancing economic competitiveness.
    But political analysts said Baudouins statements showed
growing divisions over electorally sensitive social issues
among the rightist RPRUDF coalition, ahead of its bid next
year to capture the presidency from Socialist president
Francois Mitterrand.
    While the government has achieved lower inflation, a better
foreign trade balance and an overwhelmingly successful
privatisation programme, unemployment has continued to edge
upwards, reaching its present record rate of 10.9 pct, with
more than 2.5 mln jobless.
    Seguin, who holds direct responsibility for dealing with
unemployment, told a press lunch, "Everything depends on what
you call reflation...One can arrive at the results of a
reflation without passing through the perverse effects of a
reflation."
    He said conservative prime minister Jacques Chirac would
announce in the next few days a package of capital endowments
for stateowned enterprises including public works and motorway
building.  And while sources at Seguins ministry said the
package could total 12 billion francs for 1987, sources close
to Balladur, making no mention of public works, said only 8.6
billion francs had been set aside for capital endowments.
    Seguin said the advantage of public works was that they
were noninflationary and had a fast jobcreating power.

<TITLE>SOLAR SYSTEMS ltSSDN>, INKEY OF SPAIN SET PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it
agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell
condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.
    It said a spermicide used in INKEYs condoms contains an
ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
condoms made by INKEY.
    The company also said it is changing its name to
Eurocapital Corp shortly.
    Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
U.S.based ltEuropharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own
the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
being developed by INKEY.
    The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
process to be a lengthy one.
    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
tested in a spermicide.
    Inkeys condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
name, "Carlton." The exclusive distribution contract for the
products runs for three years and is renewable for oneyear
periods, the company said.
    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
not gone on sale in other European countries.
    It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
the FDA.
    The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little
or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar
Systems interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below
its current 45 pct.

<TITLE>KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Owners of two aluminum smelters in
Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates
after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate
hike to Big Rivers Electric Corp of Henderson, Ky.
    But the owners of the smelters, National Southwire
Aluminum Co and Alcan Aluminium Ltd ltAL>, said further
viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the
rate case is eventually settled.
    "Were hoping for no rate increases but we cant say for
sure. Its still possible well have to close the smelter," a
National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other
variables to consider in any decision whether to close or
continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles
west of Louisville.
    National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc
ltNII>, which holds about 55 pct, and Southwire Co, which
holds the rest, the spokesman said.
    A spokesman for Montrealbased Alcan said, "The decision is
48 pages long and is in legalese, so it certainly will be a
long time before we can make a decision" about what it means
for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of
Louisville. "But were delighted that Big Rivers Electric was
denied the requested rate increase."
    A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates
and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the
requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.
    The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the
increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which
include Manufacturers Hanover Corp ltMHC> and Irving Bank Corp
ltV>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility
spokesman said.
    The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out
a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index
their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.
    "We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to
assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable," he said.
    No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned
between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant
owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for
July 28.

<TITLE>FORMER BROKER PLEADS GUILTY IN U.S. TAX SCHEME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A former vice president of Painewebber
Inc pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to charges he
conspired to launder over 700,000 dlrs in cash from investors.
    Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebbers highest paid broker between
198286, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy and
falsifying brokerage records.
    Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year,
admitted he received cash from various clients, and converted
the funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements by
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
    Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactions
except for the commissions he received.
    U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 for
sentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on each
count and 260,000 dlrs in fines.
    Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentified
supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currency
transaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cash
transactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to the
IRS.
    David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case,
said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000
dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amounts
under 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on several
different days.
    Outside of Court, Eders lawyer, Milton Gould, said his
client was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insider
trading scandel. Rather, Gould said, "Eder accomodated some
wealthy customers who wanted to avoid taxes."

<TITLE>TRIPLEEXPIRATION MAY JOLT STOCK MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Stern, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The stock market could be jolted one
way or another on Friday as the socalled triple witching
expiration raises the specter of volatile movement.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average could soar or plunge as
much as 100 points, or both, or even remain static, according
to analysts of the stock and stock index futures markets.
    The simultaneous expiration of March stock index futures
contracts, options on these futures and options on the indexes
themselves, along with options on individual stocks, has
created a mad scramble during several previous "witching
hours."
    Upon expiration of these vehicles, investment managers must
find a place for their funds, and in the past the final hour
has seen a tremendous surge in New York Stock Exchange volume.
    Analysts said the overriding influence of the stock
markets steady climb this year  and the absence of
worthwhile investment alternatives  may indicate that the
major players will look to buy into the stock market as the
final hour transpires this friday.
    "I think there will be a substantial swap out of futures
positions and into stocks," Jeffrey Miller, of Miller Tabak
Hirsch and Co said. "But Ive got a streak of four or five in
a row of being right, so Im bound to be wrong."
    The feeling among some analysts is that the largest money
managers will do the same thing they did at Decembers
expiration when they plunged their multibillion dollar funds
into the stock market.
    "Last time, during tripleexpiration, there was a
tremendous amount of stock sold, which was offset by huge buy
programs late," said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Inc analyst
William Marcus.
    Some stock funds quickly place newly arrived investment
dollars into buying futures positions, Miller said. Then, upon
the expiration of the futures, the manager looks to transform
that into a stock portfolio, he said.
    The coming month is also a seasonally strong period for the
stock market, Stotler and Co analyst David Hightower said,
because of the influx of income tax refunds.
    Although Hightower recommended steering clear of trading
during the witching hour, he suggested buying if the market
plunges, believing that the slide would only be temporary.
    Marcus said it was difficult to make a prediction as to
which way the market will go on Friday, partly because many
investors will be engaging in "windowdressing."
    The public disclosure of order imbalances in individual
stocks a half hour before the close may reveal an opportunity
to those investors seeking either to buy or get rid of stocks,
offsetting whatever impact the initial imbalances show.
    Analysts said efforts by exchanges to quell the volatility
on tripleexpirations are unlikely to substantially alter the
impact of futures and options on the stock market. Money
managers are sure to find other types of loopholes that emerge
under the new rules, they said.

approved a defensive common stock purchase rights plan.
    Under the plan, shareholders will receive one common shares
purchase right March 31 on each outstanding share of record on

    Each right entitles shareholders to buy one share of common
stock at an exercise price of 4.50 dlrs. The rights are
exercisable only if a person acquires 20 pct or more of the

    Bobbie Brooks said the rights are not being distributed in

<TITLE>API SAYS U.S. CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The American Petroleum Institute
said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8
pct from yearago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day.
    In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API
said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured
by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln
barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.
    API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct
from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.
production of more than one mln barrels a day.
    API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last years level.
    So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which
was up 2.9 pct from last years yeartodate level, has slowed
in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of
1986.
    It said crude oil production for the first two months of
1987 was off 8.6 pct from the comparable yearago period while
crude imports were up 30.6 pct.

<TITLE>EASED RESTRICTIONS TO CREATE NEW PHONE SERVICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Brough, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Consumers may benefit from new
telephone services if business restrictions against the
regional Bell companies are eased, but safeguards against rate
hikes may be needed, congressional and industry analysts say.
    An easing of the restrictions by the U.S. District Court
would help bring new services to markets that the regional
firms are currently prohibited from serving, the analysts say.
    But consumer groups add that there is a danger the regional
companies would raise rates to subsidize entry into new markets
and safeguards would be needed to prevent that.
    Brian Moir, a spokesman for the International
Communications Association, a national group of telephone
users, said, "If there are no safeguards, there will be higher
rates, less competition and less consumer choice."
    The seven regional Bell companies created from the breakup
of American Telephone and Telegraph Co ltT> in 1984 have been
prohibited by the terms of the divestiture decree from
manufacturing equipment, offering computerized information
services or providing longdistance service.
    U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who presided over the
divestiture and continues to enforce its terms, is currently
considering a Justice Department recommendation to eliminate
the restrictions except on longdistance service within a Bell
holding companys local service region.
    In separate filings last week, the regional Bells asked
Greene to remove restrictions, while industry and consumer
groups including the Consumer Federation of America joined ATT
in asking that all or most of them be retained.
    ATT, which has about an 80 pct share in the interstate
longdistance market, said in its filing it would not oppose
entry by the Bell companies into computerized information
services but was against their participation in longdistance
services and manufacturing equipment. ATT does not offer
computerized information services.
    ATT has asked the Federal Communications Commission, in a
separate proceeding, to reduce price and rate regulations that
have dominated the longdistance business for many years.
    Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to ease
restrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said.
    "The restrictions prevent people who can provide services
from providing them," said a congressional aide.
    However, a major concern among consumer groups and
lawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those new
businesses from higher charges to their customers.
    "Were talking about activities funded directly or
indirectly off the backs of ratepayers," said Moir.
    One congressional aide said he was not worried about
subsidizing new businesses from profits, but he was concerned
that the Bell companies may overcharge consumers so that they
can invest in new services.
    Some analysts said accounting regulations would protect
consumers against crosssubsidization by the Bell companies.
    "Those are types of things that really do need review," said
Gerry Salemme, an aide with the House Telecommunications,
Consumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee.
    He added that the House would hold hearings later this year
to examine the potential effects of reduced restrictions.
    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation, which represents
more than 200 consumer groups, said accounting regulations were
inadequate because accountants could not separate equipment
employed for traditional and new services.
    "We have yet to see adequate regulatory safeguards that
exist that prevent crosssubsidization by the Bell companies,"
Kimmelman said. "Youre either asking for great increases in
rates or a great opportunity for crosssubsidization."
    One congressional aide expressed concern that lifting of
the restrictions would lead to joint ventures between U.S. and
foreign firms in manufacturing telecommunications equipment and
that could lead to a loss of American jobs. He suggested some
safeguards may be needed to protect against that happening.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>ltTransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> said
it denies that Coastal Corp has standing to file a plan or
reorganization for TransAmerican in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
    In an earlier statement, TransAmerican said, Coastal
claimed its rights to file a reorganization planhad been
affirmed by the court. "Coastal claims they have standing, but
no final determinatioon has been made," TransAmerican said.
    The company said various Coastal subsidiaries have made
unsecured claims totaling 700,000 dlrs which are disputed by
Transamerican.
    The company said it has a claim against Coastals Coastal
States Trading Inc subsidiary for almost three mln dlrs. This
claim resulted by a breach of contract in the trading companys
failure to provide crude oil to the Good Hope Refinery in
Louisiana which was operated by TransAmericans predecessor
company, ltGHR Energy Inc>.

<TITLE>NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A new International Natural Rubber
Agreement INRA will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of
the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.
    "The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents
a significant step forward in international economic
cooperation," he told a news conference. The new INRA is to
replace the current one which expires in October.
    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the
auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
UNCTAD, reached agreement over the central elements of a new
accord last weekend.
    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price  of
201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo  and indicative
prices set in the present pact.
    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint
Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added.
    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of
price ranges  the "may sell" and "may buy" points at plus and
minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the "must sell"
and "must buy" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.
    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that
were set in the present accord. "The most important of these are
to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between
demand and supply," he said. The buffer stock remains the sole
instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and
its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto
added.
    At this months session, which was the fourth attempt in
two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be
resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference
price.
    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price
every 15 months  instead of the current 18month intervals.
    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.
    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator
price has been above the upper intervention "may sell" price
currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents or below the lower
intervention price "may buy" price 171 cents at present for
six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or
whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council
decides.
    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these
circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a
higher adjustment.
    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to
300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three
pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher
percentage.
    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had
strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference
price and the "lower indicative price" or floor price of 150
cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently
360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.
    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last
Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.
    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of
the new pact.
    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the
new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments
accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world
imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became
operational.
    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.

<TITLE>EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Sugar which EC producers plan to sell
into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for
sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its
latest sugar review.
    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very
nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit Ecu to the
intervention price, with detrimental consequences for
producers returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an
attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered
sugar.
    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade
producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time
limit on storage contracts, which presently means that
intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,
Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production
quotas being reduced.
    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for
export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at
recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference
between the EC price and the world market price, the extra
costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.
    The producers might have to repay these costs through
production levies and the proposed special elimination levy,
Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs
could be recovered under EC rules.
    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of
sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the
EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to
bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,
Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of
protest designed to force the Commissions hand.
    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for
intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure
that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in
1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,
West German producers face a further price reduction in July
with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark.
    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is
not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to
traders for some years that the ECs export policy is
insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it
says.
    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by
increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,
suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut
down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the
export tender system.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of German Cooperative
Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
would continue to remain low for the time being.
    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
foreign influence and it saw no intereststraining factors in
the economy that could affect the longterm capital market.
    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
nominal rates at years end and next year, it said.
    The association said generally low interest rates,
prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
its slow but very sure growth.
    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
rates down on the shortterm money market although its policies
had exerted little effect on the longterm capital market,
which was so important for investment financing and thus for
the course of the economy, it said.
    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
had in influencing the longerterm capital market, the
association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
through a shortterm and expansionist monetary policy.
    On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
    The association said time would show to what extent
speculative foreign money and shortterm invested domestic
money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.

<TITLE>FEDS JOHNSON URGES STRONGER ALLIED GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that the U.S.s main industrial partners
should expand their domestic growth.
    In a speech to a womens group here, Johnson said, "There is
room for stronger domestic growth in those countries ... strong
enough to absorb growth in U.S. export markets."
    Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange
rates now and the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies has
brought western nations a long way towards establishing that
goal.
    Johnson said, "The Fed supports this pattern of exchange
rates ... and well see if it leads to a convergence in trade.
Quite possibly it can be achieved."
    Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better
alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the
major surplus countries.
    He said this was "a major improvement and a step in the
right direction" and added U.S. allies look very strongly to a
U.S. budget deficit cut. "There will always be a potential risk
of breakdown in international cooperation" without a budget
deficit cut.

<TITLE>U.K. MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT, ANALYSTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Slower than expected growth in Britains
narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a
further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterlings
value requires such a move, economic analysts said.
    M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official
target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget
speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.
    On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 41/2
pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.
    "The M0 data are much better than we expected," said Robert
Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.
    He and other analysts said while the better than expected
M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new
interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.
    Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite
buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct
after a fall of the same size in January.
    Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in
consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not
an adequate indicator to determine interest rates.
    "The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is
important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate
and the election which call the tune," Lloyds Merchant bank
chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.
    Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,
said in a comment "It is unlikely that Lawson will respond to
signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate
trends is necessary before action is taken."
    "With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are
made in response to signals from this narrow money variable,
the City has been forced to take it seriously," he added.
    Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of
last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.
    This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.
Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the
pound above unofficial targets, analysts said.
    Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed
between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at
their Paris meeting last month, they added.
  U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the
Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when
foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut
in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.
    They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and
analysts expect them to shed another halfpoint in the coming
week.
    Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than
expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the
annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous
target of 11 to 15 pct.
    Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the
improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few
months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be
drawn after revised data are released on March 31.
    Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to
watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawsons move to scrap it
altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its
credibility as a key factor in monetary policy.

    Merrill said it was disappointed by Moodys conclusion. It
noted that earnings more than doubled in 1986 to 454 mln dlrs.
Equity capital rose 23 pct to 2.9 billion dlrs and return on

has said it is mulling a bid to seek control of Baird Corp,
said it has no present plans to acquire more than 25 pct of the
companys total outstanding common stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mark IV said its top officials told Baird executives at a March
17 meeting that while Mark IV may buy more Baird common stock,
it presently intends to hold it to the 25 pct limit.
    Mark IV, which first disclosed its stake and interest in
Baird on March 10, has reported it holds 391,800 Baird common
shares, or 17.6 pct of the total outstanding.
    Mark IV said it also agreed at the meeting that if it
decides to seek control of Baird, it would be through a
negotiated merger or business combination or through a tender
offer in which Baird would have at least 24 hours notice.
    Baird, in turn, agreed not to take any defensive measures
without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice, it said.
    Baird also confirmed that a takeover defense plan it
already has which is triggered by the accumulation of more than
25 pct of its stock, would not be triggered by a tender offer,
Mark IV said. Both parties also agreed to adjourn pending
litigation they have against one another, it added.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS ANNOUNCE PLAN FOR STEEL CLOSURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>European Community EC industry
ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,
drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated to
lead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.
    The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, which
should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,
"remain considerably below the surplus in capacity."
    They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with
Eurofer, major steel companies and with governments, to
pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the
annual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.
    The Commission will draw up a new system  of steel
production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full
rigors of open competition.
    Commission sources said any new system would cover only
heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, instead
of 65 pct under the present system.
    Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet
again in Brussels on June 1, the sources said.
    Industry Commissioner KarlHeinz Narjes told ministers
capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that
this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990.

<TITLE>U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A statement yesterday by Secretary
of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
    They said that Shultzs comments, while not explicitly
endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
because they were not negative towards such action.
    In response to a query on what the State Departments
position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
    The Soviet Union, the worlds largest grain importer, has
bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
to sell the Soviets lowerpriced wheat through the export
enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
Union, grain industry sources said.
    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
another 21/4 cents by midday at 2.881/4 dlrs per bushel,
while CBT March wheat was up 11/2 cents at 2.921/2 dlrs.
    "Im not sure this is an aboutface, but its clearly a
recognition that unless were competitive, we wont sell to the
Soviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
    "We have to be competitive. Its ridiculous to say that
somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
thing at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farm
leaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with the
Soviets," he said.
    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
    National Wheat Growers officials were taking a cautious
attitude towards the secretarys comments.
    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didnt in our
judgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official with
the wheat group said.
    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there is
significance in that fact that we havent seen any significant
negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."
    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
officials said.
    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he
Shultz has taught for years as an economist," but said they
dont necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultzs statements.
    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
    "If he didnt say no, then theres a chance. This is
potentially a positive development," a commodity source said.

<TITLE>EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission has
decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne
imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.
    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and
nonEC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports
from Spanish ports south of Valencia.
    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authoritys
cereals management committee today.
    The tax had been introduced last September at the same time
as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports
of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.
    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into
Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from
being reexported back to them.
    The sources added that Spain had received no answer from
the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the
sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.
    The request will be considered at the committees next
meeting, the commission sources said.
    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of
maize this year, while an ECU.S. accord guarantees nonEC
producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000
tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

acquired by a partnership for either 15 dlrs a share in cash or
at least 10 dlrs in cash and uniuts of securities.
    The partnership that made the first offer for Comdata was

entered into an agreement, which collapsed, for a repurchase of
six mln shares at 14.50 dlrs each and for the sale of one mln
shares by a director to ltMason Best Co>. Mason Best already

    A group led by ltRosewood Financial Inc> has also disclosed
ownership of 6.2 pct of Comdatas 19.0 mln shares outstanding
and said it might seek to increase its interest to over 15 pct.
    The company said Comdata shareholder approval would also be
required for its proposal.

<TITLE>U.S. CONGRESS THIRD WORLD DEBT PLAN ADVANCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A House Banking subcommittee
approved a plan to seek U.S. negotiations with other
industrialized countries for the purchase of developing country
debt from commercial banks.
    The plan is expected to face opposition in the full House
Banking Committee, where approval must be obtained to send it
on to the full House for a vote, congressional sources said.
    Under their plan, Treasury Secretary James Baker would be
directed to consider setting up a public debt authority to
purchase developing country debt at a discount. The debt would
be repackaged for sale to a secondary market.
    The debt plan was offered by International Development
Institutions subcommitte chairman Walter Fauntroy, a nonvoting
Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.
    The negotiations would aim for renegotiation of third world
debt with the new U.S. Public Debt Management Authority. The
new U.S. institution would act as manager for the loans and
oversee economic policies of the developing countries.
    One of its main purposes is the reduction in the debt
service burden of developing countries, Fauntroy said.
    In addition, the bill asks for a study of the issuance of
of Special Drawing Rights to developing countries.

<TITLE>UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The "cross field allowance" relief on
Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller nonPRT
paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,
adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
advanced.
    The government would in effect be subsidising these
developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
corporation tax, the report said.
    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRTpaying
field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
small nonPRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
pct.
    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
will these costs be unavailable for offset against the fields
future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
be lost.
    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
time.

<TITLE>CONGRESSMEN URGE U.S. SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Several leading farmstate
Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture
Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make
soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.
    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman
Dan Glickman, DKan., proposed that Congressmen and
representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the
subject in the next two weeks.
    "Lets see if we can try to push them USDA to do
something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.
    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per
bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.
    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president
said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.
    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both
worlds," ASAs Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is
too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of
soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,
the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income
support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.
    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.
    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture
Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA
so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.
    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,
but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they
would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the
soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied
extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any
changes, are under consideration.
    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other
than a marketing loan which should be considered to help
soybean growers, such as a socalled producer option payment,
or a direct payment program.
    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit
Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise
to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of
soybeans could be forfeited between September and endyear.
    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazils entire
soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.
    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in
making soybean program changes that might allow the European
Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.
    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean
production and loss of that market would be devastating.
    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on
whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be
successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.
    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu
loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed
a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, DLa., which would set a six
dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.
    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking
Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward
Madigan of Illinois.
    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take
some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan
could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.
    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one
to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore
must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.
    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu
combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might
fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the
government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs
would decline as market prices recovered.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PLAN TO EASE LDC DEBT ADVANCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. House Banking subcommittee
approved a plan to seek negotiations with other industrialized
countries for the purchase of developing country debt from
commercial banks.
    The plan is expected to face opposition in the full House
Banking Committee where approval must be obtained to send it on
to the full House for a vote, congressional sources said.
    Under their plan, Treasury Secretary James Baker would be
directed to consider setting up a public debt authority to
purchase developing country debt at a discount. The debt would
be repackaged for sale to a secondary market.
    The debt plan was offered by International Development
Institutions subcommittee chairman Walter Fauntroy, a
nonvoting Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.
    The negotiations would aim for renegotiation of third world
debt with the new U.S. Public Debt Management Authority. The
new U.S. institution would act as manager for the loans and
oversee economic policies of the developing countries.
    One of its main purposes is the reduction in the debt
service burden of developing countries, Fauntroy said.
    In addition, the bill asks for a study of the issuance of
of Special Drawing Rights to developing countries.

<TITLE>COKEltCCE> SAYS ITS UNIT ITS PRICING PROBE TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>CocaCola Enterprises Inc said one
of its key bottling subsidiaries is being investigated by a
grand jury for possible price fixing violations of its soft
drinks.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company said its MidAtlantic CocaCola Bottling Co
understands a federal grand jury in Norfolk, Va., is probing
the matter and it is "possible" that it will be indicted for
violating antitrust laws.
    The current probe stems from the conviction last month of
an Allegheny PepsiCola Bottling Co employee, it said.
    In the trial of the Allegheny Pepsi employee, Armand
Gravely on October 28, 1986, MidAtlantic CocaCola Bottling Co
and eight of its employees, including some high ranking
officers, were identified as unindicted coconspirators in the
price fixing scheme, CocaCola Enterprises said.
    Gravely was convicted on February 12, 1987 in a scheme to
fix soft drink prices in Virginia between Allegheny Pepsi and
MidAtlantic CocaCola, the company said.
    While MidAtlantic CocaCola was not named as a defendent
along with Gravely, the company said the probe into the Gravely
case is still under way and could result in indictments.
    CocaCola Enterprises has already said MidAtlantic
CocaCola Bottling Co and some of its officers have been under
investigation by the Norfolk grand jury since September 1984.
    The new disclosure was made in a filing with the SEC for
offerings of 250 mln dlrs of debentures due 2017 and 250 mln
dlrs of notes due 1997.
    Proceeds would be used to refinance outstanding debts, the
company said. Salomon Bros is lead underwriter.
    CocaCola Enterprises is 49 pct owned by CocaCola Co ltKO>.

<TITLE>NEW JEFFERIES ltJEFG> CHIEF PLANS NO CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg Calhoun, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Jefferies Group Incs new chief
executive Frank Baxter said the company intends to review its
operations, following the resignation of founder and chairman
Boyd Jefferies, but he has no immediate plans for changes,    
"Well be examining all our practices," Baxter said in a
telephone interview, adding, "we do not expect any changes."
    Baxter also said he does not believe that any other
Jefferies employees will be cited for wrongdoing.
    Boyd Jefferies, Jefferies Groups founder, agreed to plead
guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities
laws, Jefferies Group said in a statement released earlier.
    The statement said the charges against Boyd Jefferies
resulted from a transaction in which he, on behalf of the
company, agreed to purchase certain stocks from entities
controlled by Ivan Boesky and later resell the stock to those
entities.
    "That was Boyds transaction," Baxter said.
    Baxter said that although Jefferies Group was censured,
there were no fines imposed on the company and no restrictions
placed on its business. He said he believes the news of the
allegations and Boyd Jefferies resignation should not affect
client confidence.
    Michael Klowden, an attorney for Jefferies Group, said that
although investigations are continuing into trading activity in
general, he does not believe any probe is focusing on Jefferies
Group or its employees.
    "We dont anticipate any actions of any consequence,"
Klowden said.

<TITLE>TEXAS COMMERCE ltTCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Julie Vorman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
relatively stable oil prices and the banks planned merger with
Chemical New York Corp ltCHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
from last years profits of 20 mln dlrs.
    Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
earnings to increase.
    "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
over last because we are stronger," Love said, referring to
Texas Commerces pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
lower Texas Commerces cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
basis points, Love said.
    The Texas CommerceChemical merger is the only acquisition
by a major outofstate bank since Texas lawmakers approved
interstate banking effective January 1.
    Hardhit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas
struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc ltALBN> lost 17.6
mln dlrs, MCorp ltM> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation ltFBT>, which is actively
seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
dlrs.
    Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the banks
nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
    "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us," he
said. "The fact that the real estate market is still moving
away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
nonperforming loans."
    In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerces net loan losses
related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
banks losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
pct.
    More than half of Texas Commerces nonperforming loans,
which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
    Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
years, he said.
    "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
barrel," he said.
    Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
build up its consumer banking business, Love said. "We are
resuming what we did best for years  an offensive position,"
he said.
    In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
DallasFort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
banks, he said.
    One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
in December, InterFirst Corp ltIFC> and RepublicBank Corp ltRPT>,
both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
at 570 mln dlrs.
    The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
banking market, has not changed Texas Commerces expansion
plans for the states secondlargest city, Love said. "We think
we can try to get a little part of their roost," he said.
    The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
    "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products," he
said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
credit cards and investment banking.

<TITLE>SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN, EUROPE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of
the presidents council of economic advisors, said stronger
domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to
help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher
dollar declines.
    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign
industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed
expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on
further dollar depreciation," he told the Futures Industry
Association.
    Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in
Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the postwar
period.
    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial
countries would help give balance to the current world
recovery," he said.
    Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last
month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed
Japans economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of
1986, "Not enough to sustain employment growth."
    However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges
and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax
reform. "I suspect there will be further moves," he said.
    Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S.
government spending and for resistance to tax increases.
    "Reducing the federal government budget deficit by
expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal
tax rates achieved by tax reform," he said, adding that "a vote
to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax
reform."
    Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially
restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration
of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.
    However, he said that "sole reliance on dollar depreciation
to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable," as it risks
inflation in the United States and recession abroad.
    "I am confident that further improvements in our trade
performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987," he
said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will
come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and
present "serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners."
    Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment
have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the
improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.
    He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in
rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable
policies that produced them.

<DATELINE>    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>International Lease
Finance Corp is negotiating with ltAirbus Industrie> for
additional orders of A320 and A330 jets, according to ILFC
president Steven UdvarHazy.
    ILFC, a commercial aircraft leasing concern, last week set
conditional orders with Airbus, the European consortium, for
three shorthaul A320s and three A330s.
    "Were negotiating with Airbus for additional units beyond
those six planes," UdvarHazy told Reuters in an interview.
"Were talking mainly about more A320s, but also about more
A330s," he said. He declined to elaborate.
    Reports in the French press today indicated that ILFC was
close to signing an agreement to buy 27 of the A320 jets.
    The total value of the order announced last week is 350 mln
dlrs. The jets are scheduled for delivery beginning in 1991.
However, the order for the A330s is conditional on a decision
by the Airbus board to launch the plane.
    Airbus has said it will decide by the end of this month
whether to launch the medium range A330 and the companion, long
range A340. It says it has 104 orders and options from nine
airlines for the two planes.
    ILFC is one of the launch customers for the A330,
UdvarHazy noted.
    Earlier today, Swissair dealt a blow to Airbus by opting to
order six MD11 long range aircraft from McDonnell Douglas Corp

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS ltAXP></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Cos plan to sell a
stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
analysts said.
    American Express earlier said it has a general
understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
price of 2.7 times book value.
    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
times book value.
    American Express was trading today at 781/4, off 3/8. For
the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
a spinoff of part of Shearson.
    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
important Tokyo financial markets.
    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," said
Long.
    "What you will see probably in the future is American
Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
have a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.
    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
into an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.
    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
    American express has said the total employees of shearson
will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
spokesman said.
    American Express officials would not comment beyond a
statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
for Shearson.
    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
    "I think theyll figure out what theyre going to do with
the money they have," he said.
    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
    In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
the investment by Nippon.
    American Express said options under study range from
expanding Shearsons capacity to meet international competition
to broadening its access to capital.
    American Express also said the options reflect the
continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express
worldwide financial services strategy.
    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
    "Those U.S. brokers companies have the expertise. They
dont have the money. Theres just not enough internal capital
growth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
U.S. brokerage companies.
    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those
Japanese companies have the capital and our companies have
the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the
money. Thats a nice marriage," he said.

<TITLE>ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Liberalization of Italys foreign exchange
controls should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a report
issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury
Ministry said.
   The report, looking at the countrys financial development
prospects, said Italys large public sector deficit and growing
public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual
liberalization preferable.
    The report also favoured retention of the liras six pct
oscillation band with the European Monetary System EMS during
the liberalization process in order to lessen shortterm
domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from
portfolio adjustments.
    The liras fluctuation margin is currently significantly
higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.
    Italy has over recent months announced a series of
deregulation moves in response to a European Community
directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods,
services and finance by 1992.

<TITLE>UAW SETS STRIKE DATE AT GM ltGM> TRUCK PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers has set a March
26 strike deadline at General Motors Corps Pontiac, Mich.,
truck and bus plant, a UAW spokesman said.
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that the 9,000
UAWrepresented workers at the facility will walk off the job
at noon EST next Thursday if an agreement is not reached by
that time.
    "We will be on strike. If the workers are still in there,
they will come out," the spokesman, Reginald McGhee, said.
    The union earlier said it today notified GM of its intent
to authorize a strike at the Pontiac facility.
    The UAW gave GM what it calls a "fiveday letter," which
gives the company five days to come to an agreement before
workers go on strike. The letter was effective at noon today.
Weekend days are not included in the fiveday period, McGhee
said.
    The spokesman could not say what the chances were for a
settlement. "At this point, its too early to say" whether the
plant will be struck, McGhee said.
    The UAW earlier said the strike notification is expected to
"trigger an intensive effort to resolve disputed issues."
    Talks between the UAW local at the plant, Local 594, and GM
officials were continuing today over disputed contract issues,
including the main issue of whether the company can subcontract
jobs to nonunion workers.
    McGhee said the two sides are also discussing health and
safety matters and relief time.

    A company spokesman said Sticht will serve as chairman
until April 1988, when he will retire. He said the appointment
of Sticht was recommended by Johnson.
    "These key management actions will significantly strengthen
the companys leadership," Johnson said.

<TITLE>LATIN POLICY ADJUSTMENT URGED BY CEAS SPRINKEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Beryl Sprinkel called on Latin American governments to
adopt sounder economic policies and said U.S. banks loans to
those countries had already been written down in an economic
sense.
    "Latin governments will have to adopt policies that promote
growth for their own citizens," he said, adding that the record
has been mixed.
    Brazil, he said, recently has backtracked from better
economic policies and "obviously they have to change."
    Asked if U.S. banks ultimately would be forced to write
down portions of their loans to Latin America, Sprinkel said,
"In any realistic sense, economic sense, those loans have been
written down."
    The banks could not sell the loans at par, he said, and the
price/earnings ratio of major banks stocks has not been doing
very well.
    "Clearly the lenders have suffered," said Sprinkel.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Industrial and financial groups will be
allowed to take a share in stockbrokers capital when Paris
Bourse regulations are liberalized beginning next year,
Stockbrokers Association chairman Xavier Dupont told a news
conference.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur announced on March 10
that the monopoly of French stockbrokers to trade on domestic
bourses will be phased out by January 1992, the date for the
creation of a unified European financial market.
    Balladur said that from January 1988, the capital of the
brokerage houses would be opened French and foreign banks.
    The minister did not specify which other institutions would
be allowed to take stakes in the brokers capital but said that
from January 1, 1992, "access to the Bourse will be open to any
new member under the control of the Bourse authority."
    Dupont said that in opening up the capital of the 45 Paris
brokerage houses, the stockbrokers association had "killed one
of its sacred cows."
    Association officials said Dupont would meet all the
stockbrokers on March 31 for an exchange of views on the
measures to be taken and future of the Bourse.

<TITLE>MEXICO TO SIGN LOAN AMID CALLS FOR CHANGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Mexicos 7.7 billion dlr loan package
will be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from
both creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous
process of raising such jumbo loans, bankers said.
    Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal
has been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared.
    Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even
now, five months after the loan was agreed with a 13bank
advisory committee on October 16, dozens of Mexicos some 400
creditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate.
    The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact
that it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since
the regions debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will also
sign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt.
    Moreover, as the first major package built on U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Bakers strategy of offering loans to countries
willing to implement marketoriented, progrowth policies,
intense market scrutiny was only to be expected.
    Still, the split within the banks ranks came as a shock.
"This is not an unsuccessful operation, but weve had more
bickering than ever," one senior banker commented.
    Officers at small banks that have sold, swapped or or
written down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why
they should throw good money after bad.
    Major lenders counter that small banks must share the
responsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep
receiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones.
    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said
recently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered
the entire Mexican package. Things have improved, but money
center bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant
banks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached.
    The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed. "People who
are outside shouldnt think theyve been saved once we get over
7.7 billion dlrs," one warned.
    But rounding up "freerider" banks entails such a huge
drain on management resources that more and more bankers are
acknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink.
    One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of
current exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier "base"
date  August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamlining
idea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans
for "exit bonds" that a debtor would issue at a discount.
    Argentina has pressed for this solution, so far to no
avail, arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditors
account for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the
next 120 banks account only for a further six pct.
    Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina
may not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it is
seeking until September, which would be a year after
negotiations began with the International Monetary Fund.
    The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of
investors in Argentina, forcing up interest rates and spurring
capital flight, he said.
    "We have to introduce some common sense into the
discussion," Machinea said this week in Cambridge, Mass.
    He was echoed by Mexicos deputy planning minister, Pedro
Aspe Armella, who said the delay in signing his countrys loan
has made it difficult to map economic policy with any
certainty. "Its a sad affair," he told the Cambridge meeting.
    Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in
the loan that it suspended its debtequity swap program last
month to put pressure on the banks. Other strains have
intensified between U.S. and nonU.S. banks, partly because
U.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns.
    Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much on
ensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short
term, possibly to the detriment of longerterm solutions.
    Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican
deal are American, some foreign bankers think other U.S. banks
should make up the difference.
    This issue of "national share" was defused on the Mexican
committee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with
Argentina and Brazil, whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has
already suggested separate negotiations with regional
committees of creditors.
    Streamlining of the newmoney process is running parallel
with efforts to develop a broader "menu" of alternatives to new
loans, such as trade credits or debtequity conversions.
    "We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising
new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank
syndications," Mulford said last week. He told the banks to
stop complaining that there is no leeway in current procedures
and to come up with ideas. Some steps have already been taken 
interest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banks
are debating whether to accept partial interest payments from
the Philippines in paper instead of cash.
    Because the banks want to isolate hardline Brazil by
clinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable, bankers
said the Argentine package is likely to be along the
established lines of the Baker Plan.
    But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal,
when it comes, will be radically different.
    As such, the loan for Mexico could go down in the history
books as the biggest but also the last jumbo. "Im convinced
itll be the last one in this form," one banker said.

<TITLE>TRANSCO PARTNERSHIP ltTXP> GAS RESERVES RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Transco Exploration Partners Ltd said
participation in 14 new discoveries increased its proved gas
reserves to 558.1 billion cubic feet in 1986, up from 541.5
billion cubic feet in the previous year.
    Proved reserves of liquids remained about the same at 25.1
mln barrels, the company said in the 1986 annual just released
by Transco Energy Co ltE>, the majority owner of the Transco
Exploration partnership.
    Transco said that anticipated oil and gas prices during
1987 would continue to exert pressure on the profitability of
most energy companies.
    The Transco pipeline system reached permanent takeorpay
settlements on about half its committed gas deliverability and
interim agreements for another 38 pct of its deliverability,
the annual report said. The company said it paid a total of
about 363 mln dlrs to producers through Februry one out of its
550 mln dlr reserve to settle the takeorpay disputes.
    Transco said its gas pipeline delivered more than 1.2
trillion cubic feet last year and its marketing affiliate sold
an average of 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day.
    The companys exploration partnership received an average
price of 1.84 dlrs per mln cubic feet for gas sales during
1986, down from 3.04 dlrs in 1985.
    Sales of oil and condensate averaged 15.86 dlrs per barrel
last year, down from 27.41 dlrs per barrel in 1985.

<TITLE>AMOCO ltAN> OIL RESERVES DOWN, GAS UP IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Amoco Corps petroleum liquids reserves
total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77
billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased
to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the companys
annual report said.
    It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid
reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates
caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This
accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision
of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision
occurring in the United States, the report said.
    Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its
worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last
year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased
298 billion cubic feet of reserves.
    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these
gains, the report said.
    All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14
mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United
States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to
acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.
    Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions "will be an
integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available
at attractive prices."
    The company said it expects "the marketing climate for
natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the
opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand
improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our
inventory of attractive opportunities."
    Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget
of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs
last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.

<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Caisse de depot et placement du
Quebec, the government agency which manages the provinces
pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net
profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
    The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
    These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
year, which was below the Caisses average return of 16 pct in
the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
    The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
    The agencys holding of U.S. government securities yielded
a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
13.5 pct for all funds under management.
    "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency
said of the U.S. securities.
    The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in
Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln
dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.
    The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of
Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other
Quebec government issuers during the year.

<TITLE>ASEA GROUP ltASEAY> SEES FLAT 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Asea Group, the diversified industrial
concern based in Vasteras, Sweden, said it expects 1987
earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flat
compared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,
or 371.1 mln dlrs.
    A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted
significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear
power plants.
    This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to
profitability by Aseas power transmission segment, which had a
loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
    Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.
    The spokesman said the company has built up a strong
backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and
beyond.
    At yearend 1986, Aseas order backlog stood at 32.7 billion
crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5
billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.
    Asea has operations in power generation and transmission,
transportation equipment, pollution control and robotics.
    Total sales in 1986 were 46 billion crowns, or 6.8 billion
dlrs.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 228 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln
dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs.
The week was the first half of a twoweek statement period. Net
borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the twoweek statement period that ended on
March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net
free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs
first reported.
    A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no
large single day net misses in the Feds reserve projections in
the first week of the latest bank statement period.
    None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the
discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday
borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a
whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large
regionals and the small banks.
    Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday 
for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason 
to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.
    The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of
transportation float in mid and southAtlantic states. Noting
that the weather was "basically good" for March, the spokesman
said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a
day for the full week.
    Float related asofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on
Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error
corrections in five districts.
    Asofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.

<TITLE>SEA CONTAINERS ltSCR> EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Sea Containers Ltd predicted
its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10
mln dlrs over the same period a year ago.
    The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than
fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln
dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs.
    James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects
to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first
quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for
first quarter fiscal 1986.
    The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally
slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea
Containers business.
    Sherwoood said the companys losses were largely
attributable to nonrecurring events and provisions. He cited
the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,
costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.
    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing
two of its subsidiarys ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr
provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and
severance pay costs.

<TITLE>FIRST INTERSTATE ltI> ESTIMATES BRAZIL RISKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>First Interstate Bancorp said its
1987 pretax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs if
it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium to
longterm loans to Brazil as nonperforming.
    But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to
reclassify the debt, despite Brazils Feb 20 suspension of
direct interest payments on medium and longterm loans.
    "The corporation believes that it is premature to make a
decsion to classify such medium and longterm debt as
nonperforming at this time," First Interstate said.
    But First Interstate said that if Brazils suspension of
interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its
loans as nonperforming and place them on nonaccrual, meaning
that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted
from net income and interest would no longer be accrued.
    Besides its medium and longterm debt, First Interstate
said it also has 165 mln dlrs in shortterm loans or trade
lines in Brazil.
    As of Dec 31, 1986, nonperforming Brazilian outstandings
were about 4.1 mln dlrs, it said.

<TITLE>SEC OFFICIAL PROPOSES EQUITY, FUTURES TRADE HALT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and commodity
exchanges should consider establishing a mechanism for halting
trading of equities, futures and options when there is unusual
price volatility, a top Securities and exchange, SEC, official
said.
    Richard Ketchum, director of the SECs division of market
regulation, said a "short, systemwide halt" of trading of
stocks, futures contracts and options on futures contracts
would "let everyone get a breath" in especially volatile
markets.
    Ketchum made his remarks in connection with a Futures
Industry Association panel discussion on stock index futures
and stock market volatility.
    The SEC official did not attempt to define "volatile"
markets.
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Susan
Phillips later told reporters that exchanges already have the
authority to halt trading if an emergency is declared.
    But she said Ketchums proposal was "something to look at"
and that she expected the exchanges to explore procedures for
making order imbalances public.
    William Brodsky, president of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, CME, told Reuters that considering Ketchums proposal
would be a "worthwhile exercise," but that implementation of a
trading halt mechanism posed "major, philosophical, economic
questions."
    Ketchum said price limits on contracts "are not
particularly useful in dealing with volatility."
    Earlier, Brodsky announced the CME board of directors had
decided last Tuesday to drop a plan to set a 12point limit on
the daily price movement of its Standard amp Poors 500 contract.

<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The United Steelworkers of America
said that bankruptcy Judge Burton Liflandss refusal to act on
a union lawsuit was "a gross denial of due process for 47,000
retired employees of LTV Steel."
    The union is seeking an injunction that would require LTV
Corp ltQLTV> to reinstate 400 dlr monthly supplements to about
7,000 retirees. The union said that the judge, at the request
of the ltPension Benefit Guaranty Corp>, delayed proceedings
until May four. It said the case was originally to have been
heard on February 27.
    The union said LTV stopped making monthly payments in
February after Pension went before Lifland and received
permission to terminate LTV pension plans covering 47,000
retired hourly workers.

Dole proposed to allow the use of daytime running lights as a
measure to improve safety on the highways.
    Dole said in an announcement that in Sweden and Finland, 
where daytime lights have been in use, the number of crashes
and lives lost has been reduced.
    The transporation department said there might be confusion
in some states whether the lighting device was legal.
    Therefore it proposed an amendment to federal motor vehicle
safety rules to make clear that frontmounted lights could be
installed at the option of the manufacturer.

<TITLE>ECUADOR INDUSTRY AND TRADE MINISTER RESIGNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuadors Minister for Industry and Trade
resigned today, but denied he was responding to recent protests
against a new austerity program that went into effect after a
devastating earthquake.
    Xavier Neira, an economist, told reporters he was stepping
down for personal reasons and would return to his private
business as a foreign trade consultant.
    He defended government austerity measures adopted last
Friday as a "necessary antidote" to the losses from the March
five quake which cost an estimated one billion dlrs in damage
and left 1,000 people dead or missing.
     Ecuadoran unions have called for a general strike next
Wednesday to press for a suspension of the belttightening
measures, which include a rise in gasoline prices of up to 80
pct, budget cuts of up 10 pct and a government hiring freeze.
    Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries OPEC, has been forced to halt shipments
of crude, its main export, for about five months until it
repairs a pipeline that ruptured as a result of the quake.

<TITLE>HOUSE GOP BUDGET WRITERS WITHHOLD VOTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Republican members of the House
Budget Committee refused to cast their votes as the committee
began marking up the outlines of next years federal budget.
    Republicans voted "present" during votes on a ceiling for
fiscal 1988 defense spending, saying they were protesting the
Democrats failure to present an alternative to President
Reagans budget, which was completed in January.
    Without the Republicans votes, the Democratic majority on
the committee voted tentatively 138 to cap 1988 defense
spending at 282.6 billion dlrs, three billion dlrs more than
current year defense outlays.
    Rep. William Gray DPa., the Budget Committee chairman,
decided earlier this week to use current government spending
levels as a starting point for the panels deliberations.
    In the past, the committee Democrats had always gone behind
closed doors to agree in advance on a draft budget plan.
    But this year, the Democrats could not come to an
agreement, prompting Gray to invite the Republicans to join
them in the drafting process in open session.
    Republicans argued that this maneuver enabled the Democrats
to avoid presenting alternatives to the presidents budget.

<TITLE>SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of State George Shultz has
decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
last summer, and hes not going to the mat again. Its now
basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
they want to do," the official said.
    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
he wont go to the President and voice his objections."
    In an official statement clarifying Shultzs remarks
yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
Program."
    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
Moscow, the State Department official said.
    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
State Department source said.
    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
    Government and commodity sources also said there are
elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

<TITLE>MORGAN GUARANTY ltJPM> SUES METROMEDIA FOR NOTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co said it filed
suit against ltMetromedia Inc>, seeking a redemption at par of
Metromedia subordinated discount debentures.
    The debentures due 1998, were issued in 1984 and were zero
coupon notes for the first five years. Beginning 1990, they
were to receive semiannual interest payments at an annual rate
of 16 pct.
    Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, stems from the recent
voluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionally
created an event of default on the notes. 
    The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each
1,000 dlrs principal amount of debentures. The figure takes
into account the deep discount the holders received when they
bought the issue.
    Morgan Guaranty said there is about 30 mln dlrs principal
outstanding.

<TITLE>EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U.S. TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC
Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation
is a misguided attempt to deal with the nations trade deficit
and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.
    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
legislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign Trade
Association here.
    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he
warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a
productforproduct basis.
    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
product," Denman said.
    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,
however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.
    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European
exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely
to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to
Europe," Denman said.
    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require
countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to
cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.
    "This would conflict with international obligations, throw
a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
could easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.
    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek
reciprocity in specific trade sectors.
    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
would simply lead to retaliation from the other party," he
said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
another.

    HydroQuebec is seeking regulatory approval to sell 70

<TITLE>GM ltGM> PARTS WORKERS TO VOTE ON CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIVONIA, Mich., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Workers at a General Motors Corp
parts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new
contract that would change the way many of the workers do their
job.
    Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GMs
Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local
contract to replace their current agreement with the company,
according to officials of both the union and the company.
    The proposed accord would initiate the socalled "team
concept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of
GMs Inland Division.
    Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the
plant would be responsible for the entire product and would
make some of their own decisions about assembling that product,
said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that
represents the workers.
    An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of
the accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacity
problem.
    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues
are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on
a new national accord are expected to begin in July.
    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as
soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a
member of the locals executive board.
    The pact would also stay in place through the next national
contract, he said.
    Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the
new accord. "Its going to be close either way," he said.
    Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is
not ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials
said. The GM spokesman said "no decision has been made to that
effect."

<TITLE>SENATORS SAY JUSTICE MISHANDLED TENNECO PROBE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Justice Department mishandled an
investigation into alleged fraud on Navy contracts by a unit of
Tenneco Inc ltTGT>, two senior senators charged.
    The charges, made jointly by Sens. William Proxmire,
DWis., and Charles Grassley, RIowa, were based on a report by
subcommittee staffs of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the
Joint Economic Committee on the Justice Department
investigation.
    "Serious mistakes were made at every stage of the Newport
News investigation and much time wasted during lengthy periods
of inactivity," the report said.
    The Tenneco unit, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock
Co, asked the Navy in 1976 for reimbursement of 894 mln dlrs in
cost overruns in the construction of 14 nuclearpowered ships.
The Navy settled the claims for 208 mln dlrs in 1978 and then
refered the case to the Justice Department for investigation of
possible fraud.
    In 1983, the Justice Department decided to end the
investigation without prosecuting Newport News.

<TITLE>IMF OFFICIAL RESIGNS CHARGING U.S. LOAN PRESSURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>One of the top executives of the
International Monetary Fund IMF has tendered his resignation
charging that the United States has been pressuring the agency
to reduce the conditions it places on some loans, monetary
sources said.
    C. David Finch, an Australian who heads the IMFs exchange
and trade relations department, told the IMF executive board on
Wednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next month
after 37 years with the agency.
    The sources said that Finch, in a statement considered
unprecedented, told the board that the United States had
brought undue pressure on the IMF to approve funding for Zaire
and Egypt.
    "To resign in this manner is highly unusual, perhaps
unprecedented," a monetary source said.
    Neither Finch nor U.S. IMF Representative Charles Dallara
could be reached for comment.
    The IMF, since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982,
has pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut back
on social spending as conditions to granting assistance.
    The United States recently has been taking the position
that countries that take needed economic reform measures
relying more on market forces and private enterprise should be
encouraged by assistance from the IMF and development banks.
    Zaire, under the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko
has recently been taking many reform measures designed to heal
its ailing economy.
    The IMF last year approved a 22month loan package for
Zaire totaling 270 mln dlrs.
    The United States has been considering the possibility of
seeking access to a military base in Zaire but no decision has
been reached.
    Egypt, for its part, has been holding talks with the IMF
aimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loan
package with the United States pressing for a quick deal,
according to the sources.
    However, they said a tentative plan for Egypt that is
currently being reviewed by the management of the Fund prior to
going to the executive board for full approval has raised a
number of questions about the countrys ability to repay.
    Egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of U.S.
Middle East policy.
    The department headed by Finch, among other
responsibilties, makes certain that IMF policies and loan
conditions are wielded evenly among countries.
    Monetary sources have said that the United States had
brought pressure on the IMF to approve a loan package for
Mexico using economic conditions that have not been broadly
used before, but Finch, according to the sources, made no
reference to this.
    Under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago by
Treasury Secretary James Baker, the United States made the
decision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow out
of their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures.
     He also recommended that commercial banks provide 20
billion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while the
mutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years.
    A key part of the proposal gave the World Bank a much
greater role in dealing with the debt crisis, in part because
of its familiarity with developing countries and their
problems.
    The initiative, while widely heralded as a good first step
toward improving the the growing debt crisis, was viewed by
some at the IMF as a rebuke of previous austerity measures
insisted upon by the Fund in return for loans.

<TITLE>ECUADOR GETS LOAN TO HELP REPAIR OIL PIPELINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The Andean Development Corp CAF said
today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25
miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this
month.
    the loan was signed here today in the offices of the
caracas based caf by the corporations president, galo montano
perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil.
    the loan had originally been intended to finance an
expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the
ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as
to permit their use in reconstruction.
    Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four
months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to
help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is
repaired.
    The OPEC member has a production quota of 210,000 bpd but
has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310,000 bpd
once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss.

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST U.S. CREDIT POLICY IS ON HOLD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Latest Federal Reserve data suggest
that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into
a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary
policy is on hold, economists said.
    "There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift
gears at the present time or for at least another month," said
Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    "Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is
nothing for the credit market to get excited about," added
Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Adjusted bank borrowings from the Feds discount window
averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank
statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln
and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.
    Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision
in banks net free reserves in the twoweek period to March 11
to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.
    Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14
money center banks were absent from the Feds discount window
for the third week running, with the latest weeks borrowing
split between the large regional and the smaller banks.
    While modest open market intervention was apparently enough
to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest
statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have
to be more aggressive in coming weeks.
    The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly
on four of the five trading days via system and customer
repurchase agreements.
    "Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense
pressure," said Salomons di Clemente, noting the approaching
month and quarterend and the round of holidays and tax dates
in April.
    "The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding
requirement," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,
who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon
purchase in early April.
    Economists were also heartened by further signs of a
deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely
discredited M1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M2
and M3 aggregates.
    M1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,
compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly
M2 and M3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.
    "The M1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we
are on our way to another moderate set of M2 and M3 figures
for March," said Salomons di Clemente. Merrills McCarthy said
they could even come in below the bottom of their respective
target ranges.
    In February, M2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper
limit and M3 was 20.8 billion beneath.
    Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnsons encouraging remarks on
inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some
economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend
support to calls for further accommodation here.
    "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in
rates before anything else," said Salomons di Clemente, adding
that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of
the U.S. economy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economys
health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary
to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and
inflation could lead to higher rates first.
    Drexels Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding
that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when
Februarys U.S. trade data are due for release.

<TITLE>U.S. SAYS NO SIGNAL BEING SENT BY SHIP MOVEMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. Navy battle group led by the
U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Sea
amid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coast
of Iran, U.S. officials said today.
    But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports the
naval strike force was in the region did not mean the United
States was sending a new warning to Iran against escalating
attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.
    "Nothing like that has happened," he said. "No signal is being
sent."
    He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area where
it usually does. "Its normal. Its in the waters where its
supposed to be. Its been there for over a month."
    The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay
of the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area
extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.
    With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the
south and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to
the north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of
the strategic Straits of Hormuz.
    The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm the
exact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.
    State Department officials cited concern about the safety
of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply
run to the Gulf.
    Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulf
and U.S. officials have said that Teheran has recently equipped
itself with powerful Chinese and Italianmade antiship
missiles, posing a greater threat.

<TITLE>COSTA RICA SELLS SUGAR TO SOVIET UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     SAN JOSE, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Costa Rica has agreed to sell more
than 32,000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union, a
spokesman for local producers said.
     Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of the
sugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut
in Costa Ricas quota for sugar exports to the U.S.
    Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exported
to the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similar
to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic.
    A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific port
of Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship will
take an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later.
    Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the
price at which the sugar was sold.

<TITLE>DANGER OF ARBITRAGE TRADING DOWNPLAYED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Stock indexrelated arbitrage
trading did not spark the dramatic drop in the U.S. stock
market last September, nor is a freefall in stocks and futures
prices due to arbitrage trading a likelihood, a top official
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, said.
    Richard Ketchum, director of SECs division of market
regulation, told the Futures Industry Association that a
commission study of the circumstances surrounding the plunge in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average last September 1112 shows
stock indexrelated arbitrage trading those days was
substantial but did not set off the price fluctuations.
    "While indexrelated arbitrage trading was a very
substantial part of the trading that day, it was by no means
the predominant part," Ketchum said.
    He said the study would be released next week.
    Indexrelated arbitrage relates to efforts, primarily by
institutional investors, to profit from price differentials by
shifting funds between stock index futures and their underlying
stocks.
    Some commodity exchange officials fear federal regulators
or Congress might move to restrict trading of stock index
futures in an effort to curb stock price volatility.
    Ketchum said the slide in stock prices was the result of a
"fundamental change in investors perceptions of economic
conditions," triggered by "incorrect rumors" that West Germany
was set to cut its discount rate.
    The SEC study indicated the seven firms that accounted for
most of the arbitrage trading those days made 127 program
trades on September 11 and 117 trades September 12, accounting
for only 17.5 pct of the "sell side of the New York Stock
Exchanges volume," Ketchum said.
    He also said there was virtually no options indexrelated
arbitrage activity those days.
    Ketchum called "triple witching days"  the Fridays each
quarter when stock index futures and options and opions on
individual stocks expire simultaneously  a "relatively minor,
overdone question" that has "relatively easy solutions."
    Moreover, "futures do not appear to have an impact on
longterm or probably even daily volatility," he said.
    Finally, Ketchum said a freefall in stocks and futures
prices driven by program selloffs of stock index futures and
individual stocks was unlikely.
    "We believe that the amount of money now available to come
in on the other side of the market by institutions make it
unlikely that that kind of snowballing effect would happen," he
said.
    But he said federal regulators could not discard the
possibility and would continue to be concerned by the issue.

<TITLE>NEW CHIEF ELECTED FOR WORLD SUGAR ORGANISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over
as executive director of the International Sugar Organization
ISO in midApril, ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff
said.
    Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at endFebruary
last year.
    Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the "house in order"
by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved
allocations of voting rights and financial contributions.
    Once this is done, time can be dedicated to working towards
a new International Sugar Agreement ISA with economic
clauses, he said.
    Ricart, currently the Dominican Republics ambassador to
Austria, the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva, said he will
visit the four major exporters  Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
the European Community  to talk to governments and producers
and find out about problems that are preventing these countries
finding common ground for a new sugar pact.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The International Sugar Agreement ISA
will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization ISO
officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a
special session of the pacts council.
    A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO
six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an
autumn London conference for another pact without economic
clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a
Genevabased conference next year for a new pact with economic
clauses, he said.
    But delegates said the latter would only be considered if
the worlds four major exporters  Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
the European Community  can resolve differences over how
prices can best be supported and how to share the world
    Todays special session was called because the U.S. earlier
indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of
the ISO budget.
    At todays council session Politoff said the U.S. would try
and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later
this year. Currently, about three quarters of this years ISO
800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the
U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full
contribution in the last year of the current pact.
    The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO
budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers
and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the
importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a
single category of members who would all share the costs pro
rata to their share of world sugar trade.
    The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the
next full council session in the week of May 19.
    There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.

<TITLE>E.C. OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Whether the European Communitys
Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable
oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,
an EC official said.
    "It is very far from certain that it will go through," Sir
Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told
reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.
    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West
Germany has opposed it in the past.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened
retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.
soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.
    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about
agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to
single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put
agricultural policy on a special fast track.
    "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the
framing of the GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on
both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate has unanimously
called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live
up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its
markets to U.S. Chipmakers.
    The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties
on Japanese hightechnology products containing semiconductors
in retaliation for what it sees as Japans violations of the
semiconductor pact.
    While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action,
Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer
legislation would be considered if the violations continue.
    "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the
Senate feels about this matter," Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd told the Senate.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the
Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at
correcting Japans unfair trade practices.
    A key House trade lawmaker, Representative Richard Gephardt
also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries
with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a
year for three years.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>President Ronald Reagan said he
would veto any tax increases voted by Congress.
    "My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid,"
Reagan said during a televised news conference.
     The president said he opposed efforts by some members of
Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the
GrammRudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    "Its time Congress cut the federal budget and left the
family budget alone," Reagan said.
    He said the congressional budget process was in desperate
need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S.
constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.
    "This yearly deficit feeding process must stop," he added. "We
must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the
budget."
    In the meantime, he said, Congress cannot back away from
the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said.

told that profits from sales of arms to Iran had been used to
aid the U.S.backed "contra" rebels in Nicaragua.
    "No, that is not true," he said before a televised news
conference when asked about reports that he had been told about
the money diversion by his former National Security Adviser,
John Poindexter.
    Reagan was giving his first formal White House press
conference in four months since the Iran arms affair burst into
scandal with the disclosure profits from weapons sales had been
diverted, possibly illegally, to the contras.
    He said the secret approach to Iran had resulted in the
release of three American hostages held by proIranian elements
in Lebanon and that it might have freed more if the operation
had not been made public.
    Reagan told reporters  as he had told a presidential
commission that investigated the scandal  that he did not
remember when he had approved an August, 1985, shipment of U.S.
arms to Iran through Israel.
    Reagan opened the news conference  seen as vital in
rebuilding his damaged presidency and restoring his authority
 with a statement on the yawning U.S. budget deficit.
    He again stated his opposition to tax increases and called
for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    Asked if in hindsight he would again start a secret program
to sell arms to Iran, Reagan said, "No, I would not go down that
same road again."
    Tonights news conference was widely seen as an opportunity
for Reagan, 76, to demonstrate he was in command of affairs
despite the crisis.
    Reagan said, referring to the Iran arms program, "If I
hadnt thought it was right in the beginning, I never would
have started it."
    He said he went into the deal because he was persuaded that
he was not dealing directly with the kidnappers.
    "You cannot do business with them," he said.
    But "suddenly you have a third party there Iran ... and it
was not trading with the kidnappers," he said.
    The news conference in the White House East Room lasted 32
minutes  two minutes more than normal  most of which was
devoted to the Iran affair.
    At the last minute, a reporter asked whether Vice President
George Bush had opposed the arms sales as Secretary of State
George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had done.
    Reagan replied, "No," smiled, waved and walked away from the
podium toward the White House residence.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. STILL PROBING ACID RAIN PROBLEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the U.S.
government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.
    "Were still investigating this," he told a nationally
televised news conference.
    Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S.
industry to help address the problem.
    However, he declined to endorse the writing of federal
standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem.
    The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion
dlr, fiveyear program to deal with acid rain, a problem that
troubles U.S. relations with Canada.
    Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government
should set emission standards.
    He responded that the deeper that officials went in
examining the acid rain problem, the more complex it appeared.
    He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a
measure that might ultimately prove fruitless.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.
    President Reagan said during a nationally televised news
conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a
problem that the administration is studying.
    "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we
increased the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but we have to do
more," he said.
    Reagan said his administration has already proposed
deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits
tax on crude oil production.
    However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved
those measures.
    The Department of Energy earlier this week released a
report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil
imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It
suggested options for the administration to consider, but made
no specific recommendations.

<TITLE>BELGRADE UNIONS ATTACK YUGOSLAV PAY FREEZE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BELGRADE, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Belgrade trade union leaders have
joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia and
reported strikes spreading to the capital.
    Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions
council, said the government must take responsibility for the
effects of the law imposing the wage freeze.
    Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and will
remain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarter
of 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged to
productivity. The move has caused resentment and widespread
industrial unrest throughout the country.
    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag
Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on
strike in Belgrade.
    Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communist
political system and their role has traditionally not been to
defend workers from the government. The criticisms by the
Belgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentment
of the law than earlier reported.
    The government has officially reported 70 strikes
throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have
indicated there have been more.

<TITLE>WEIZSAECKER CALLS FOR EASIER ARGENTINA DEBT TERMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker called on creditor banks to ease pressure on
Argentinas foreign debt repayment terms.
    "We cannot remain indifferent to the pressure of creditor
banks, since there is correlation between political stability
and the economic situation," Weizsaecker told reporters.
    Argentina said last month it would suspend debt payments if
creditor banks did not loosen repayment terms and grant a new
2.15 billion dlr loan.
    Argentinas debt is Latin Americas third largest at 51
billion dlrs.
    Weizsaecker, on a fourday official visit to Argentina,
said "Argentinas problems require joint action from creditor
and debtors countries," and not prepared recipes from creditor
banks.
    A group of ecologists staged a demonstration to protest
Argentinas plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant and a
German companys role in the project as a contractor.
    Earlier, Weizsaecker said that the potential of Patagonia,
the barren tableland covering a third of Argentina, could
assure the economic future of the country.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     LA PAZ, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>About 9,000 miners employed by the
state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from
midnight 0400 gmt to press for higher salaries, a statement
by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said.
     It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised
mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the
government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it
showed an intention to meet the strikers demands.
     The government said the strike was designed to cause it
embarrassment during the fourday visit of West German
President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.
    The miners statement said police had violently evicted
Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a
hunger strike yesterday.
    The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its
deficitridden corporation since the collapse in the
international price of tin. The layoffs represent about
twothirds of the original workforce.

<TITLE>CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NINGBO, China, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Chinese port of Ningbo is
working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from
Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said.
    Jiang Feng Xiang said the port  the deepest in China 
handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln
in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln
tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.
    Jiang said Ningbo is underutilised because of its
inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line
linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.
    Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal
from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and
soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can
handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to
200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.
    Most of Ningbos port infrastructure has been built since
1979, official publications show. A container berth and two
timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the
current 198690 fiveyear plan, Jiang said.
    "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995.
By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added.

    There has been speculation the U.S. Administration was

<TITLE>JAPAN ECONOMIC PACKAGE AFTER BUDGET  MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures
immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament.
    The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as
the government has decided to compile a 50day stopgap budget
for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a
proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.
    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.
    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or
early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.
    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary
conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in
early April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on
the matter, taking into account parliament debate.
    The package is likely to include a record amount of public
works spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800
billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion
for public works. Japan expects the stopgap budget to help
spur the economy, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to
the controversial sales tax without any revision.
    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks
by a top government official as indicating a revision of the
tax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.

<TITLE>VOLCKER SAYS U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a
challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of
Sputnik.
    "The international challenge implicit in our huge trade
deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of
Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared
we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological
achievement," he said in an address to Florida educators.
     He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform
the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance.
    The Commerce Department reported last week that the
nations trade gap, calculated on a balanceofpayments basis,
swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs.
    Volcker called on educators to stress the development of
basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to
help students adapt to the fastchanging economic climate.
    Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of
lowincome minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics.

<TITLE>SHORTTERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese shortterm interest rates,
buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall from
the beginning of April when the new financial year begins,
money traders said.
    The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend
following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its
discount rate cut on February 23, they said.
    The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and began
actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate
rises resulting from the endoffiscalyear surge in demand for
funds from financial institutions.
    Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as
aggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank has
failed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said.
    Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to
compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has
underpinned shortterm rates, they said.
    Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen
were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September.
    This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising
to 17,830 billion yen by the endDecember, a threefold
increase on endDecember 1985 levels, bankers said.
    On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000
billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal
funds, money traders said.
    From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate will
fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the onemonth
commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635
pct.
    They predict the threemonth bill discount rate to slip to
3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the threemonth certificate of
deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The stateowned Krung Thai Bank Ltd
will start taking over stateowned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete
the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told
a press conference.
    He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem
the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition
between the two stateowned institutions.
    The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank
branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts,
while others will continue operating but under Krung Thais
name.
    Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance
Ministry took over and renamed the Asia Trust Bank Ltd.
    Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month
her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At
the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was
ranked 12th among Thailands 16 local commercial banks.
    Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to
seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private
management and was taking legal action to collect another four
to five billion baht of doubtful debts.
    Krung Thai is Thailands third largest bank.

<TITLE>JAPAN TURNS AWAY FAKE SOUTH KOREAN FOOTWEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese customs, faced with a flood of
fake Reebok sneakers from South Korea, have turned away some
100,000 pairs since last summer, Rebook officials said.
    A Ministry of Finance spokesman said officials at the ports
of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama and Kobe had begun barring
counterfeit footwear but declined to say how many pairs.
    A spokesman for Reebok Japan, the local subsidiary of
Reebok International ltRBK> of Avon, Massachussetts, said the
firm had complained of the influx to the Ministry last July.
    "They use our trademark and everything. And its easy to
fake our trademark," the Reebok spokesman said.
    He said customs had sent back some 100,000 pairs to South
Korea, but the Finance Ministry declined to confirm this.
    "Because of various reasons, we cannot say how many pairs
have been turned away," the ministry spokesman said.
    The Reebok spokesman said an unspecified number of fake
Reeboks have made it into the country, and were being sold at
cutrate prices in Tokyo and Osaka stores.
    "They go for about 20 to 30 pct less than the price of
genuine Reeboks," the spokesman said. A pair of real Reeboks
sells for about 10,000 yen in Japan.
    The government last summer warned stores not to carry the
shoes and Reebok has sued two for continuing to sell them, he

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  ASIAN DROUGHTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gavin Greenwood, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Three geographically diverse droughts
in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
reintensification of the complex and littleunderstood El Nino
weather pattern, ltAccuWeather Inc>, a commercial weather
forecasting service, said.
    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
officials and meteorologists said.
    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
over 20 years, the paper said.
    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
rivers, it added.
    This has resulted in reduced hydroelectric power, causing
shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
China, media reports said. The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has
recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
since early February.
    The New China News Agency said the average December
temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
    Severe drought is affecting about onethird of Sri Lanka
and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop, Ministry of
Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
    In Australia, concern is growing about belowaverage
rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt, local
Meteorological Bureau officials said.
    For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
El Nino, they said.
    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
AsiaPacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single
cause, El Ninos role is being closely studied, they said.
    AccuWeather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino event
was unique.
    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
major event in 1982/83, it said.
    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around
Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
winds, meteorologists said.
    The winds, strengthened by El Ninos "pump" effect, raise the
sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
rainbearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, AccuWeather
said.
    China, where the affected areas have received between 40
and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
MaySeptember rains, it said.
    The MaySeptember rains normally provide the
droughtstriken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
    In Australia, areas of Queenslands coastal strip have
received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
as the rainy season draws to an end.
    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
at its maximum for the year. The years secondary rains usually
occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.

<TITLE>VOLCKER SAYS BRAZIL DEBT MOVE WILL NOT HURT BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Matt Spetalnick, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker said the suspension by Brazil of its
foreign debt payments would not undermine U.S. Banks.
    But he told Reuters after a speech to educators that it was
in the interest of U.S. Banks to complete debt financing plans
soon with Brazil and other debtor nations.
    "I dont think its going to undermine public confidence in
the banking system from Brazil alone," he said. "But I would like
to see further progress made on this whole situation."
    Brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspending
interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to private
banks, opening a new round in the fiveyearold debt crisis.
    Last week, Ecuador suspended interest payments to private
foreign banks, which hold about twothirds of its total 8.3
billion dlr foreign debt, citing severe damage to its oil
industry caused by an earthquake.
    Citicorp ltCCI> the largest U.S. Bank, said last week that
it might have to reclassify most of its 4.6 billion dlrs in
Brazilian loans as nonperforming, thus removing them as part
of the banks expected incomeproducing assets.
    Analysts said such a move would sharply reduce Citicorps
profits and might result in similar measures by Brazils other
bank creditors.
    Volcker said he believed Brazil and Ecuador want to
maintain continuity in their debt service.
    "Its fundamentally in their best interest. If they can get
the financing and refinancing thats necessary, they may be
able to make their economies grow again."
    Asked whether he expected other nations to follow the path
taken by Brazil and Ecuador, he said the two countries were
special cases. He did not elaborate.

<TITLE>CHINA OMITS KEY REFORM FROM PARLIAMENTARY AGENDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Hardliners have blocked debate on a key
economic reform in Chinas parliament, a clear challenge to
reformers among the leadership, western diplomats said.
    The annual session of the National Peoples Congress next
week was to have discussed a draft law which would bolster the
independence of factory chiefs while eroding the power of local
Communist Party officials.
    The decision not to include the draft law was announced by
the congresss standing committee, the Peoples Daily said. The
committees chairman is Peng Zhen, considered one of the more
conservative figures in the Chinese leadership.
    The "factory director responsibility system" covered by the
draft law has already been experimentally introduced in state
firms over the last three years, giving managers greater
freedom from the control of factory party committees.
    Diplomats said the agenda decision appeared to contradict
assurances by top leader Deng Xiaoping that reforms were not
threatened by the current campaign against "bourgeois
liberalisation," or western political ideas.
    Earlier this week Deng raised expectations for the session
by saying plans to reform Chinas political structure would be
unveiled in 1987, diplomats said.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TEAMS STUDYING PHILIPPINE LOAN REQUESTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Two World Bank review teams are in the
Philippines to assess government requests for funding for an
expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program,
bank officials said.
    They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for
100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.
    The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr
longterm loan from a World Bankled consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its
land reform program.
    The officials said negotiations will start next month on
another 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms
in 14 major stateowned corporations.
    On Tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310
mln dlrs to help the countrys economic recovery program.
    The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans
to finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.
    World Bank sources said the banks lending to the
Philippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3
billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100
loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.
    The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs
in loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three
years of President Ferdinand Marcoss rule. Marcos was toppled
by a militarycivilian revolt in February 1986.
    "The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for
aid were not implemented properly," they said.
    The sources said the bulk of this weeks loan would be used
to rehabilitate the stateowned Development Bank of the
Philippines DBP and the Philippine National Bank PNB which
are saddled with seven billion dlrs of nonperforming assets.
    "At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were
supposed to go to the DBP," the World Bank sources said. "Over
the past three years the banks disbursement pipeline to the
Philippines almost completely dried up."
    In 1986 alone, the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in
loan repayments, about 59 pct of the governments budget
deficit of 27 billion pesos for the year, they said.
    Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last
September when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. The
sources said the loan was held up because of delays by the
government in submitting essential documents.
    The World Bank sources said the request for land reform
funding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bankled
consultative group to be held alongside the April 2729 annual
meeting of the Asian Development Bank ADB in Osaka.
    The government has said the land reform plan aims to
distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants.
    The sources said the Philippine government estimated the
entire program would cost 60 billion pesos. "About 27 billion is
longterm and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by
landowners," they said. "The landowners will be paid in 10year
bonds redeemable in ten instalments."
    The sources said the bulk of financing would cover
development costs for the land program and help to bridge the
gap between the 10year spread of payments to landowners and a
proposed 30year loan repayment period for land buyers.
    "If you include interest, the total amount of external
assistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs," the
sources said. "That volume of aid does not appear difficult."
    They said Japan, the World Bank and the ADB are expected to
provide most of the financing while the Philippines 12
bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest.
    The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines is
designed to support its balance of payments position while the
government aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross
national product growth.
    "Brazil did not do this homework," one said. "They pushed
ahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for
their balance of payments position. Manila is being more
cautious and aims at soft borrowings which, it is hoped, will
be outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in
the country emerging from debt in five or six years."
    Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE COPPER SMELTER FACES SHIPMENT DELAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Copper shipments are likely to be
delayed because of power problems at ltPhilippine Associated
Smelting and Refining Corp> PASAR, the countrys only
smelter, a company official said.
    Asked to confirm reports by New York copper trade sources
about PASARs shipment problems, marketing manager Deogracias
Madrid told Reuters, "They are partly correct. There could be a
probable delay."
    Madrid declined to give more details, or production and
export figures, saying the information could lead to
speculation.
    PASARs smelter is in the central province of Leyte.
    The New York trade sources said if PASARs shipments were
delayed, customers might have to turn to the London Metal
Exchange for supply.
    "We have a commitment to our customers and I would not like
to comment on that," Madrid said.
    A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine
copper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down
slightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985. She said production in
the first two months of 1987 totalled 34,550 tonnes, compared
with 36,462 tonnes in the same 1986 period.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Guinness Plc ltGUIN.L> said it has
started court proceedings against former chairman and chief
executive Ernest Saunders and nonexecutive director Thomas
Ward for recovery of 5.2 mln stg.
    The money was paid to Ward via Marketing and Acquisition
Consultants Ltd in Jersey.
    Guinness said earlier it would propose a resolution at the
annual meeting in May to remove Saunders and Ward as directors
of the company.  Earlier this month, lawyers for Ward told a
Jersey court that Ward saw the payment as his reward for
services in last years takeover battle for ltDistillers Co

    Guinness has said that both men breached their fiduciary
duty in authorising the payment.
    Saunders resigned from his executive positions at Guinness
in January in the aftermath of a government enquiry into share
dealings during the battle for Distillers but retained his
position on the board.
    No spokesman for Guinness was immediately available for
comment on the statement.

<TITLE>SAS POSTPONES PLANS TO BUY 12 MD11S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>SAS ltScandinavian Airline Systems>
said it was postponing a decision on a 10billion crown order
for 12 McDonnell Douglas ltMD N> MD11 airliners following what
it said was an aggressive counterbid from Airbus Industrie.
    SAS signed a letter of intent for the MD11s last December,
but a company statement said the decision on whether to harden
this up into a firm order would be linked to the outcome of
negotiations with the United States on deregulating air fares
across the North Atlantic.
    The SAS move, said by analysts to be a big blow to
McDonnell Douglas, came following a Copenhagen board meeting of
the airline in which the governments of Sweden, Denmark and
Norway jointly own a 50 pct stake. The remainder is held by
industry.
    A company statement said SAS would wait to see the outcome
of the governmenttogovernment negotiations with the United
States, in which the three Scandinavian countries have demanded
greater access to the U.S. Domestic market for SAS in exchange
for deregulating prices across the North Atlantic.
    At present SAS is allowed to fly to New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Seattle and Anchorage.
    SAS gave no details of the Airbus Industrie counteroffer
for its longrange A340, but said it will study the bid
further.
    Swissair yesterday confirmed an order for the MD11 long
haul jets worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs and said it had
preferred the McDonnell Douglas planes over the A340, a project
that has not yet been formally launched, as it met the
airlines requirements better and would be able to enter
service in 1990.
    SAS President Jan Carlzon announced the MD11 order last
December, saying the plane would replace the airlines current
fleet of DC10s. The first of the MD11s was to be delivered in
1991 for use mainly on its intercontinental routes.
    In January, SAS officials said Airbus had made a revised
offer that included larger, more powerful engines and two
versions of the fourengine plane. One would seat 220
passengers and another 260 against the MD11s 265seat
capacity.
    The offer was part of a drive to secure at least five
airline customers for the new aircraft to enable Airbus
Industrie to launch production. Airbus is expected to decide
whether to go ahead with the project next month.
    SAS officials earlier said they did not expect the first
A340 to be delivered before 1992. McDonnell Douglas had given
SAS until March 31 to agree to final terms for the MD11 deal.

<TITLE>TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The death of the worlds tropical rain
forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and
biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with
the International Tropical Timber Organisation ITTO said.
    At stake is the ability of developing nations, including
Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and
the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in
important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they
said.
    The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of
consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem
is already acute.
    The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic
dangers. "For many third world nations, the loss of the forest
is not just a loss of resources," said Delfin Ganapin, a
Philippine government consultant on environmental impact.
    "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,
now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable
logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging
foreign exchange earnings is serious," he said.
    About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that
are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops.
    Government security advisers say that as a direct result,
the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in
the upland areas, said Ganapin.
    Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods
have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known
way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within.
    "No replanting programme has been successful," said Almy
Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation.
    Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next
two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded
land in the Philippines.
    The experts say that without a major initiative from the
development banks, the vicious circle will continue with
countries cutting more forest to help service shortterm debts
at the cost of longterm insolvency.
    Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not
necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,
and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them, said
Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund WWF conservation director.
    There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end
products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a
year, he said.
    U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that
25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients
to higher plants growing in the forests.
    Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further
discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop
and produce manmade substitutes, at a cost which scientists
say is incalculable.
    By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be
exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings
will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two
billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said.
    Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,
InterAmerican, African and Asian Development Banks in 198084,
only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.
    WWF statistics show half of the worlds tropical forests
have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,
up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging
practises and by local farmers.

<TITLE>JAPAN PLANS MORE DECONTROL ON LARGE BANK DEPOSITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry plans to further
ease restrictions on largedenomination bank deposits this year
and is studying several deregulation plans, a ministry official
said, without elaborating.
    Banking sources told Reuters the ministry plans to lower
the minimum denomination of money market certificates MMCs to
10 mln yen from 20 mln, the amount slated to be applied from
April 6. The amount is currently 30 mln yen.
    The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum
period of freeinterest largelot time deposits to one month
from the current three months, the sources said.
    The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of
certificates of deposits CDs to one week to two years from
the current one month to one year, the sources said.
    They said banks fear the ministrys plans may induce a
shift of funds from bank to other financial instruments.
    One official of a major bank said the planned moves were
unexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously
expected to have ended with the measures to start in April.
    On April 6, the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum
time deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and
cut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS WORRIED OVER FUTURE OF CAP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The French farmers union, FNSEA, hopes
France will resist European Community EC pressures over farm
prices and notably those of the European Commission at coming
ministerial negotiations in Brussels, FNSEA SecretaryGeneral
Luc Guyau said.
    He told a press conference the union was concerned about
the future of the EC Common Agricultural Policy.
    France must define its position well before negotiating and
not just adopt a short term policy, he said.
    The FNSEA, with around 700,000 members, holds its annual
congress next week, when over 500 delegates will debate the
theme of "facing up to the future.
    "The period of change we are going through obliges us to
face up to new challenges," Guyau said, referring specifically
to the demographic changes in French agriculture.
    "Fortyfive per cent of our farmers are over 55 years old
this year," he said.

<TITLE>STANDARD BANK UNABLE TO MAKE EARNINGS FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd
SPRJ.J chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict
profits for the bank this year because of South Africas
continuing political unrest.
    De Villiers also warned in the annual report that "failing
prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a
future of violent deadlock between different racial and
political groupings." 
    He said South Africas future economic prospects are
"clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of
evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable
to offer an earnings forecast for 1987."
    Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC
 ltSTCH.L>, London, previously reported that 1986 net income
rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand.
    The bank said its bad debt losses should begin to decline
this year "although it may take some time before they return to
accepted industry norms."
    The annual report showed that the banks charge for bad and
doubtful debts rose in 1986 to 187.6 mln rand from 162.1 mln
rand in the prior year.
    The bank said net income of its Standard Bank of South
Africa subsidiary declined 8.2 pct in 1986 to 112.3 mln rand in
a difficult banking environment caused mainly by low credit
demand.

<TITLE>PHILIPS IN MARKETING PACT WITH U.S. FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken ltPGLO.AS.> said it planned to pool
worldwide sales and marketing of electronic test and measuring
equipment with U.S. Firm ltJohn Fluke Mfg Co Inc>.
    It said from this autumn Fluke will sell, service and
distribute Philips test and measuring products in North America
and selected markets including China, Hong Kong and Japan.
Philips will cover mainly European markets for Fluke.
    The Dutch company said it will buy a minority equity stake
in Fluke and name a board member. Its equity holding will not
exceed 10 pct, Philips said.
    The companies will also explore possible new joint ventures
to develop new product lines, Philips said.
    It estimated the worldwide market for test and measuring
equipment at six billion dlrs in 1986.
    Fluke had 1986 sales of 209 mln dlrs last year and Philips
turnover on test and measuring gear was of comparable size.
    A Philips spokesman said the world leaders in the field
were HewlettPackard Co ltHWP.AS> and Tekronix Inc ltTEK.N>, with
the combined operations of Philips and Fluke third.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community authorised the
export of 25,000 tonnes of barley yesterday, bringing the
cumulative total at weekly tenders since the series started
last June to 3.33 mln tonnes, close to the 3.37 mln under
licence in the same year ago period, traders said.
    All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to
date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the
3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French
maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes
since the tender opened in February this year. There were no
facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export
series.

<TITLE>NO BRAZIL SOLUTION WITHOUT IMF, GERMAN BANKER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A solution to Brazils debt problems
is unthinkable without the involvement of the International
Monetary Fund, Juergen Sarrazin, management board member of
Dresdner Bank AG responsible for Latin America said.
    Sarrazin told the business daily Handelsblatt that Brazils
interest payments moratorium had cost it the goodwill of many
banks.
    "Now there will certainly be no solutions without the IMF,"
he said. "Alternatives which could be imagined before, such as
bringing the IMF in with us in a loose form, are over," he said.
    Sarrazin, who through Dresdner represents German banks in
several rescheduling coordinating committees, noted that Brazil
was still prepared to negotiate.
    But he said work in the coordinating committees had already
run into difficulties before Brazils interest moratorium.
    Justified calls by debtors for more flexibility from the
banks were blocked because U.S. Regulations made solutions such
as capitalising of interest virtually impossible, he said.
    Although many European banks were opposed to the use of
interest capitalisation, "this was an alternative which has to
be brought in," Sarrazin said.

<TITLE>U.K. AVERAGE GDP RISES 2.6 PCT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Britains gross domestic product GDP
on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by
2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier,
Central Statistical Office CSO preliminary figures show.
    In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous
quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.
    The average estimate index, seasonallyadjusted and based
1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against
113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of
1985.
    The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a
whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.
    On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised
seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to
114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter,
giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO
figures show.
    On incomebased GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose
by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the
yearago quarter.
    The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.
    Expenditurebased GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of
1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same
1985 quarter.
    The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in
the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.
    The yearonyear rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with
the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9
against 109.4 a year earlier.
    For income GDP, the yearonyear rise was 2.6 pct against
against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose
2.8 pct yearonyear, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.
    The government usually considers the output measure the
most reliable way of measuring shortterm GDP changes.
    It is based on output data for production industry and
partial information for the rest of the economy.
    The government had forecast that average measure GDP would
rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget
unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.
    The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices,
rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a
2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Yearonyear, the
deflator rose 3.7 pct.

<TITLE>U.K. RETAIL PRICES RISE 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Retail Price Index RPI, Britains
measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised
basis, to give a yearonyear rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment
Department said.
    In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct
yearonyear rise on both the previous base and the new index.
    The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In
February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct
yearonyear increase on the old basis.
    The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a
rise of 0.4  0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about
four pct, economists said.
    The Employment Department said the rise in the index
between January and February was mainly the result of higher
prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss Finance Ministry said it was
calling two bond issues of a total 550 mln Swiss francs as part
of its effort to retire outstanding highinterest debt.
    The calls, to be made effective June 30 and September 30,
affected respectively the 71/4 pct bond of 1975 for 250 mln
francs and the 61/2 pct bond of the same year for 300 mln.
    A spokesman said the ministry had not yet decided whether
to convert the issues into new bonds, but it had outlined plans
for two new bonds, each of 250 mln francs. The strong state of
government finances might permit it not to issue one or both of
them, he said.

<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain suspended its daily
money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three
and sevenday repurchase agreements at 121/2 pct, money market
sources said.
    The sources said the measures were a further attempt to
rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions
to scramble for funds before the 10day accounting period for
reserve requirements closes on Monday.
    The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight
assistance to 133/4 from 131/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its
special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 141/2 pct.
    Money market sources said institutions in need of funds
were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further
assistance.
    The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary
assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more
likely to open its special borrowing facility again.

<TITLE>U.K. BUILDING SOCIETY RECEIPTSRISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K building society net receipts in
February were 472 mln stg, slightly up on Januarys 456 mln but
well below the 793 mln stg of February 1986, the Building
Societies Association BSA said.
    BSA SecretaryGeneral Mark Boleat noted that net receipts
were below 500 mln stg for the third month out of the last
four.
    "This was obviously a disappointing performance, especially
in view of the rapid growth of mortgage commitments, to over
2.5 billion stg," he said.
    The BSA said receipts were depressed by the British Airways
flotation, despite the later return of oversubscribed funds.
    Total building society receipts in February were 6.4
billion stg against withdrawals of 5.9 billion.
    Mortgage lending to home buyers during the month fell
slightly to 2.16 billion stg from 2.18 billion stg in January,
the BSA said. Mortgage lending has fallen steadily since last
Julys peak of 3.9 billion stg.
    Net new mortgage commitments however rose to 2.5 billion
stg from Januarys 1.9 billion, bringing the total commitments
outstanding to 6.9 billion after Januarys 6.6 billion stg.
    Wholesale funding rose to 292 mln stg after Januarys 29
mln, but was still below each of the last six 1986 months.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SEEN AS VANGUARD FOR CHANGING DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Keith Grant, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils hardline debt stance, though
meeting creditor resistance, is boosting political initiatives
in Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy,
regional debt officials and economic analysts say.
    "Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannot
pay, under present conditions, without sacrificing growth,"
Peruvian President Alan Garcia said, referring to Brazil.
    And, as debtors and creditors prepare for their annual
meeting at the InterAmerican Development Bank in Miami next
week, the regions debt crisis is clearly coming to a head.
    Around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have been
rescheduled since 1983, with interest rate margins now below
one pct, multiyear accords a norm and no financial crash in
sight, but a lasting solution seems no nearer.
    Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazils
suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of private
bank debt last month, though prospects of a chain default are
still remote.
    Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and others rejected such action
and Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said,
"Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary."
    But Brazils action has had an impact on other debt
negotiations, speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela last
month and influencing current talks with Argentina.
    Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts,
with the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest relief
and Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments following
a serious earthquake.
    Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lending
and accept innovative repayment schemes, not only by debtors
but also by official agencies which have stepped up their own
credit flows as part of the U.S.inspired plan.
    One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil and
Ecuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors to
link debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such as
export earnings, GDP or raw materials prices.
    Despite this, debtor countries continue to accept the
casebycase approach, and Cubas call for a joint negotiating
front is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru,
the regions flagbearer in unilateral payment decisions.
    "Each nation must negotiate its debt independently,
according to its own needs," Brazilian foreign minister Ramiro
de Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend.
    Venezuelas rapid agreement with its creditors, soon after
Brazils move, had been seen by the political opposition as a
betrayal of debtor solidarity, but de Abreu praised the
Venezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal.
    Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica and others are also pursuing
normal negotiations with creditor banks, while at the same time
pressing hard for better terms, particularly lower interest
rate spreads. Latin American officials say that while the debt
should be negotiated casebycase, their governments are
promoting a general framework for talks based on growth and
development priorities, lower interest payments and new
financing.
    "The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodox
solutions to debt cases dont work," said a senior Peruvian
government official responsible for debt affairs.
    He saw a growing likelihood that other countries would
follow Perus action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit in
the face of trade and other factors beyond debtors control
such as minimal bank lending.
    These factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr net
outflow from Latin America in the last five years, and
Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paid
back 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billion
in loans.
    Latin American debtors feel they have complied with their
side of the bargain, slashing public spending, devaluing
currencies, cutting inflation, privatizing state enterprises
and introducing debt equity schemes.
    Brazil, as the regions biggest debtor and its most
diversified economy, has now apparently adopted the principle
that a tough position with its creditors will avoid a more
serious crisis later on.
    "We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be
one of continuous crisis," Funaro told a conference in Rio de
Janeiro this week.
billion dlr debt burden this year are slim, with coffee prices
plunging, oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels and
interest rates beginning to rise.
 Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two to
three pct projected earlier, and inflation near 80 pct after
105 pct last year.
    Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct after
eight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected trade
surplus, while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct.
    Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe the
payment suspension will give new impetus to tackling the
regional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations, a
view echoed by senior international bank officials.
    Some banks, including Citibank, Morgan Guaranty and Bank of
America are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans.
    Brazils refusal to accept an IMF program, a condition set
by many banks for new lending, meanwhile reflects the view of
most Latin American governments that equate the Fund with
recession. But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries in
the region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     LA PAZ, March 19  </DATELINE><BODY>About 9,000 miners employed by the
state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from
midnight 0400 gmt to press for higher salaries, a statement
by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said.
     It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised
mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the
government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it
showed an intention to meet the strikers demands.
     The government said the strike was designed to cause it
embarrassment during the fourday visit of West German
President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.
    The miners statement said police had violently evicted
Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a
hunger strike yesterday.
    The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its
deficitridden corporation since the collapse in the
international price of tin. The layoffs represent about
twothirds of the original workforce.

<TITLE>KLM EXPANDS TALKS WITH BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>KLM Royal Dutch Airways ltKLM.AS> said
it agreed to take full control of a partially owned Dutchbased
parcel delivery service and will offer a minority stake in it
to British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc ltBCOM.L>
    KLM, seeking to strengthen its market position in the fast
growing doortodoor delivery market, said it agreed with Dutch
retailer Vendex International ltVENN.AS> to take over Vendexs
50pct in their jointlyowned courier, ltXP System VOF>.
    Ownership of XP will now be brought into the talks started
by KLM last week with British and Commonwealth for a onethird
stake in the latters ltIML Air Services Group Ltd> courier.
    When announcing the negotiations with British and
Commonwealth last week, KLM said buying a minority stake in IML
could involve a convertible loan issue.
    A KLM spokeswoman said the Dutch flag carrier would now
offer a minority stake in XP to British and Commonwealth in the
negotiations on IML, but declined to elaborate on financial
aspects of the talks.
    She said KLM would like the two courier services to
cooperate in future and did not exclude a future merger between
them to combine IMLs strong worldwide network with XPs
mainly European activities.
    XP System is based in the southern Dutch airport of
Maastricht and has an annual turnover of 100 mln guilders.
    KLM, which is also negotiating with British and
Commonwealth for a 15pct stake in the latters regional
airline ltAir U.K. Ltd>, says doortodoor delivery courier
services are seeing substantially faster growth than
traditional cargo activities.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TEAMS STUDYING PHILIPPINE LOAN REQUESTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Two World Bank review teams are in the
Philippines to assess government requests for funding for an
expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program,
bank officials said.
    They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for
100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.
    The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr
longterm loan from a World Bankled consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its
land reform program.
    The officials said negotiations will start next month on
another 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms
in 14 major stateowned corporations.
    On Tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310
mln dlrs to help the countrys economic recovery program.
    The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans
to finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.
    World Bank sources said the banks lending to the
Philippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3
billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100
loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.
    The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs
in loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three
years of President Ferdinand Marcoss rule. Marcos was toppled
by a militarycivilian revolt in February 1986.
    "The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for
aid were not implemented properly," they said.
    The sources said the bulk of this weeks loan would be used
to rehabilitate the stateowned Development Bank of the
Philippines DBP and the Philippine National Bank PNB which
are saddled with seven billion dlrs of nonperforming assets.

<TITLE>RAINBOW SAYS BRIERLEY UPSETTING PROGRESSIVE MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltRainbow Corp Ltd> said ltBrierley
Investments Ltd> BIL is trying to disrupt Rainbows planned
merger with ltProgressive Enterprises Ltd>.
    Rainbow chairman Allan Hawkins said in a statement, "In our
opinion BIL have deliberately tried to create anomalies in the
market prices of Rainbow and Progressive shares since the
merger was announced."
    The merger, announced in February, involves the formation
of a new company, ltAstral Pacific Corp Ltd>, which Rainbow and
Progressive shareholders will enter into on a oneforone share
basis. Both boards have approved the merger.
    BIL has said it was the mystery bidder behind a recent
stand in the market for three mln Progressive shares.
    "We simply regard Progressive Enterprises shares to be worth
approximately twice as much as Rainbow shares and do not think
the merger, as proposed, is soundly based," BIL chief executive
Paul Collins said in an interview in the weekly National
Business Review newspaper published today.
    Collins was not immediately available to respond directly
to Hawkins statement.
    Hawkins said the merger has been assessed by independent
consultants and declared fair in all respects, with benefits to
all shareholders.
    "We are not going to stand by while other parties distort
the picture for their own strategic purposes and distract the
market away from the real benefits of the merger," he said.
    "In our opinion, BILs actions are clearly not designed to
be in the long term interests of either Progressive or Rainbow
shareholders," Hawkins said.

    A spokesman for the Chinese National Federation of

to switch large purchases to the U.S. From Japan.
    The Federation groups all of Taiwans major industrial

billion from the U.S.
    The spokesman said Federation members were now discussing
the volume of business they could transfer to America.
    He said they had drawn up a list of about 80 industrial
products they would be shopping for in the U.S. During the
buying mission in September, but he could give no figure on how

<TITLE>SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A top Swiss banker called for an
obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and
said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company
should be made to declare their share.
    In comments at a news conference of ltVontobel Holding AG>,
chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks
own selfregulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,
to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.
    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss
franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to
prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.
    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the
market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were
readily available to professionals through specialised
information systems.
    "We should make this classification obligatory and publish
it in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said.
The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these
ratings should also be continually updated, he said.
    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,
worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares
and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.
    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The
recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG ltJACZ.Z> to take over Hero
Conserven Lenzburg ltHERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961
pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone
who was not eligible according to the companys statutes.
    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not
carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of
greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.
    "People buying, for example, more than five pct of a
companys shares should be made to declare their purchase," he
said.

<TITLE>ITALIAN JANUARY INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS 3.4 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Italian industrial production fell 3.4 pct
in January, compared with the same month last year, the
national statistics institute Istat said.
    The rise follows a yearonyear increase in December 1986
of 4.5 pct.
    Istats industrial production index, base 1980, not
seasonally adjusted, registered 93.3, compared with 96.6 in
January 1986.
    Istat said there were 20 working days in January, the same
as December, but one fewer than January last year.
    Istat said the yearonyear fall reflected poorer
performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and
metals industries.
    It said office machinery and data sectors, wood and
furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed
improved activity.
    Calculations based on Istat figures showed industrial
production rose 2.4 pct in January, on a monthonmonth basis,
after falling 12.0 pct in December over November.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK  BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Economists forecasts vary widely for
the February monthly U.S. budget deficit to be released today.
However most agree on one point  that the budget deficit for
the 1987 fiscal year will narrow substantially from 1986
levels.
    The report is likely to mean very little to the moribund
credit markets, however, which have been stilled by a stable
dollar and perceptions of steady Federal Reserve policy.
    Economists said that a leaner federal budget could help the
credit markets if it lowers the Treasurys financing needs and
results in lower interest rates, but investors may not respond
until they see evidence that this is taking place.
    Economists forecasts for the February deficit range from
20 billion dlrs to nearly 30 billion dlrs, with most forecasts
clustered in the 2628 billion dlrs range. This compares with a
deficit of 24.6 billion dlrs in February 1986.
    In January, the budget deficit was 2.1 billion dlrs,
leaving the fiscal yeartodate deficit at 65.6 billion dlrs.
    Most economists expect the 1987 fiscal deficit to fall to
180190 billion dlrs from 220.7 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
Securities Corp, expects a 26.3 billion dlr February budget
deficit, and a 186.5 billion dlr fiscal 1987 deficit.
    Stephansen expects widening in the February deficit
relative to last year based on two developments.
    First, total revenues showed a slowdown in their yearly
growth rate relative to prior months growth rates, she said,
as corporate and individual tax payments net of tax refund
payments appear to have been weak in February.
    "The second factor... is relatively strong outlay
performance," Stephansen wrote in a weekly report. "Data
available to date suggest that their yearoveryear growth is
close to 4.3 pct, well above the 0.5 pct average that prevailed
in the last four months of the fiscal year."
    Joe Liro of S.G. Warburg Securities and Co expects the
February budget deficit to total 2628 billion dlrs and the
fiscal 1987 deficit to be 190 billion dlrs.
    He said that as a result of the change in the 1987 tax code
and the new structure for determining withholding of personal
income tax payments, the Treasury is receiving less tax
receipts than it received at this time last year.
    "The Administration compounded a tricky situation by saying
how difficult it is to fill out the new W4 tax forms he said.
"The wage earner was underwithholding at the beginning of the
year and continues to be underwithheld."
    By contrast, Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government
Securities Inc said that many taxpayers have probably delayed
filling out the new tax withholding forms, so that this has not
been a drag on tax receipts as others have argued.
    "The first half of the year brought strong tax receipts
from capital gains and the repeal of the investment tax credit,
which is expected to contribute a substantial portion of the
corporate taxes to be paid this week," he said in the firms
weekly credit market memo.
    He forecast a February budget deficit of 20 billion dlrs,
and a fiscal 1987 deficit of 180 billion dlrs.
    In March, McCarthy expects to see a deficit of 23 to 24
billion dlrs compared with 30 billion dlrs in March 1986.
    But economists agreed that the federal budget deficit is
far from occupying center stage in the credit markets focus
and is unlikely to have an impact now regardless of its size.
    Yesterday, the key 71/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 closed
unchanged at 9928/32 to yield 7.51 pct after trading in a
narrow range throughout the session.
    Fed funds traded from six pct to 61/8 pct yesterday, up
slightly from Wednesdays 5.97 pct average, and are expected to
open within that range today.

<TITLE>REAGAN DEFENDS IRANDEAL, BUT WOULDNT REPEAT IT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Nagy</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, staying cool under
a televised grilling on the Irancontra scandal, insisted he
has told all he knows about the crippling affair and said he
would do it all differently given a second chance.
    "No, I would not go down that same road again," the president
said last night during a 32minute news conference, his first
in exactly four months, when asked if he would again sell arms
to Iran in hopes of freeing U.S. hostages in the Middle East.
    But he added, "Ill keep my eye open for an opportunity
again for improving relations. And we will continue to explore
every legitimate means for getting our hostages back."
    As expected, the televised conference was almost completely
dominated by questions about the secret sales of U.S. arms to
Iran and the diversion of funds to "contra" rebels in Nicaragua.
    From an investigators standpoint, the toughest question
concerned 76yearold Reagans knowledge of the contra
operation.
    As expected, the president repeatedly stated  now calmly,
now with some fire  that he knew nothing about that
scheme, said to have been run by White House National Security
aide Oliver North, since fired, with the knowledge of
presidential adviser John Poindexter, now resigned.
    "No, that is not true at all," the president replied sternly
when asked about a report Poindexter had told him, twice, about
the secret channeling of millions of dollars to the contras.
    "When I went on the air right after the news broke about
Iran arms deal last November, I did not know at that time
there was any money involved."
    He said he learned of the contra diversion  which may
have broken U.S. laws and will be the top priority of
congressional investigative hearings on this affair  only
when Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese told him on November 25.
    Just as important from Reagans standpoint, however, was
the manner in which he handled his first nonscripted public
accounting of the scandal since the details first began leaking
out last November and plunged his administration into deep
political crisis.
    He appeared to bring it off without major stumbles, abetted
by a press corps that seemed at pains to maintain a civil
manner until the very end when it crowded round him trying to
get in one last question as he was leaving the rostrum in the
White House East Room.
    He often responded slowly and deliberately but never seemed
at a loss for words, or vintage Reagan mannerisms.
    At one point in the contra discussion he furrowed his brow
in puzzlement as he said he was just as mystified as everyone
about where all the unaccounted millions had gone from the Iran
arms sales of 1985 and 1986.
    "Im still wanting to find out the source of all the extra
money, the bank accounts and where that extra money went," he
said.
    At another point, he laughed off a question on whether he
might have been told about the contra connection and forgotten,
saying, "Oh, no," pausing to chuckle and adding
    "Youd have heard me without opening the door to my office
if Id been told that."

    The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses
were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its
Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the
case, in which state prosecutors are also participating.
    The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine

Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders.

<TITLE>PRESIDENT REAGAN VOWS TO VETO ANY TAX INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>President Ronald Reagan said he
would veto any tax increases voted by Congress.
    "My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid,"
Reagan said during a televised news conference.
     The president said he opposed efforts by some members of
Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the
GrammRudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    "Its time Congress cut the federal budget and left the
family budget alone," Reagan said.
    He said the congressional budget process was in desperate
need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S.
constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.
    "This yearly deficit feeding process must stop," he added. "We
must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the
budget."
    In the meantime, he said, Congress cannot back away from
the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.
    President Reagan said during a nationally televised news
conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a
problem that the administration is studying.
    "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we
increased the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but we have to do
more," he said.
    Reagan said his administration has already proposed
deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits
tax on crude oil production.
    However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved
those measures.
    The Department of Energy earlier this week released a
report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil
imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It
suggested options for the administration to consider, but made
no specific recommendations.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the U.S.
government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.
    "Were still investigating this," he told a nationally
televised news conference.
    Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S.
industry to help address the problem.
    However, he declined to endorse the writing of federal
standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem.
    The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion
dlr, fiveyear program to deal with acid rain, a problem that
troubles U.S. relations with Canada.
    Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government
should set emission standards.
    He responded that the deeper that officials went in
examining the acid rain problem, the more complex it appeared.
    He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a
measure that might ultimately prove fruitless.

    The LCEs six week trial system starts on April 1, with

transaction, but also the date and time of execution.
    These slips will then have to be forwarded to market staff
for entering into International Commodities Clearing House
ICCH terminals within 15 minutes of the trade being
transacted, the spokeswoman said.
    The IPE system is similar, although here traders will use
timestamping machines which automatically enter the date, as
is the practice on futures exchanges in the U.S. And on the
London International Financial Futures Exchange.
    Timestamping of U.K. Futures business becomes mandatory

money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three
and sevenday repurchase agreements at 121/2 pct, money market
sources said.
    The sources said the measures were a further attempt to
rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions
to scramble for funds before the 10day accounting period for
reserve requirements closes on Monday.
    The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight
assistance to 133/4 from 131/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its
special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 141/2 pct.
    Money market sources said institutions in need of funds
were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further
assistance.
    The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary
assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more
likely to open its special borrowing facility again.

<TITLE>BONN EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR U.S. ON EC VEG OIL TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The West German government expressed
support for the U.S. Position in opposing the proposed European
Community tax on vegetable oils and fats, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
    The spokesman, speaking from Bonn, said, "We have good
reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the
proposed tax."
    Several top government officials told the American Soybean
Association and the National Soybean Processors Association
delegations there was no reason for American producers and
processors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said.
    European agriculture was facing severe problems, but both
the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the
framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, he said.
    The delegations will continue their top level meetings in
Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to
the U.S. At the weekend.
    The EC and the U.S. Realised the tax issue would stay on
the agenda for several months and there were indications that
both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations,
the spokesman said.

<TITLE>SENATE WANTS JAPAN SEMICONDUCTER PACT ENFORCED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate has unanimously
called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live
up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its
markets to U.S. Chipmakers.
    The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties
on Japanese hightechnology products containing semiconductors
in retaliation for what it sees as Japans violations of the
semiconductor pact.
    While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action,
Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer
legislation would be considered if the violations continue.
    "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the
Senate feels about this matter," Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd told the Senate.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the
Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at
correcting Japans unfair trade practices.
    A key House trade lawmaker, Representative Richard Gephardt
also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries
with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a
year for three years.

<TITLE>JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japans economic policies face fierce
international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its
trade surplus, international monetary sources said.
    At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government
officials from major nations are considering an Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD staff report
that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they
said.
    Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the
yens sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge
when growth picks up, according to the OECD.
    As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect
its exportdriven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports
by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.
    That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret
meetings of the International Monetary Funds executive board.
    The monetary sources said Japans policy was criticized
when the board met to consider the countrys economy under the
annual consultations it holds with each of its members.
    The United States, which until recently has been reluctant
to criticize Japans fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he
said.
    The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese
governments forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal
year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including
the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below
three pct, monetary sources said.
    The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to
such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic
pressure to boost an economy hardhit by the yens rise. The
yens climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge
American market.
    Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further
yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last
year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.
    Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign
Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here
today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians,
including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping
the yen will weaken, government officials said.
    At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France,
Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate
to hold currencies at around current levels.
    Officials said that wording represented a compromise.
Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few
months, before it weakens later in the year.
    Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value
for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word "recent" for
"current," while the United States wanted it to more clearly
point to the dollars weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the
word "present," they said.
    In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the
dollar dropped some 10 yen.
    The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the
market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from
rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for
the U.S. Currency.
    Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do
not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese
economy that will be triggered by the strong yen.
    Officials said there are already signs of that. More and
more companies have announced plans to move production
facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad,
they said.

<TITLE>GEODOME ltGOEDF> TO START MINE CONSTRUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAILEY, Idaho, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Geodome Resources Ltd said
following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Cos
ltRTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction
and preproduction stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer
County, Idaho, as quickly as possible.
    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It
said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per
year, with highergrade ore being mined in the first three
years for a rapid payback of capital costs.
    The company said the feasibility study calls for gold
production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the
mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with
99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune
life.
    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with allnew equipment
and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. 
It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the
associated mill by Geodome.
    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not
included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine
holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of
gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are
reserves of 1,400,000 tons of lowgrade material that could be
milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility
study used a 350 dlr gold price.
    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201
dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the
first three years, in constant dollars.

<TITLE>JAPAN ECONOMIC PACKAGE AFTER BUDGET  MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures
immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament.
    The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as
the government has decided to compile a 50day stopgap budget
for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a
proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.
    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.
    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or
early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.
    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary
conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in
early April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on
the matter, taking into account parliament debate.
    The package is likely to include a record amount of public
works spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800
billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion
for public works. Japan expects the stopgap budget to help
spur the economy, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to
the controversial sales tax without any revision.
    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks
by a top government official as indicating a revision of the
tax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.

<TITLE>JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials
said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way
and will be completed sometime next month.
    The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,
and they said Japan would comment on the final results.
    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study
has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in
the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other
commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been
officially released due to objections from some countries.
    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the
release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.
OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting
in midMay.
    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was
based on the years 197981. Japanese subsidies have dropped
sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,
and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.
    "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does
not take account of various differences in farming conditions
in each country, such as geography," the source said.
    He said it is highly likely that the final study will show
Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.
    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japans farm
market further, but this would have little impact on Japans
agriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.
    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies
by major exporting nations like the United States and the
European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.

<TITLE>VOLCKER SAYS TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a
challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of
Sputnik.
    "The international challenge implicit in our huge trade
deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of
Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared
we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological
achievement," he said in an address to Florida educators.
     He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform
the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance.
    The Commerce Department reported last week that the
nations trade gap, calculated on a balanceofpayments basis,
swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs.
    Volcker called on educators to stress the development of
basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to
help students adapt to the fastchanging economic climate.
    Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of
lowincome minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics.

<DATELINE>    PLYMOUTH, Minn., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>C.O.M.B. Co said its board has
approved a proposal to acquire the 50 pct of Cable Value
Network held by its cable television industry partners in
exchange for warrants for C.O.M.B. common.
    The company, which already owns the other 50 pct of CVN,
said it plans to change its name to CVN.
    C.O.M.B. said the proposal calls for its cable partners to

price of 18.125 dlrs a share.
    It said the 7,869,353 warrants originally offered to cable
partners will continue to vest on the preagreed schedule. The
company now has about 18.1 mln shares outstanding.
    C.O.M.B. said the transaction is subject to the parties
entering into an agreement which would be subject to approval

<TITLE>HIGH WINDS KEEP VESSELS TRAPPED IN BALTIC ICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Strong southeasterly winds were
keeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and
Swedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic
for many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.
    In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be
stuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assisting
icebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the
stranded ships, coastguard officials said.
    However, icy conditions in the southern Baltic at the
Soviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased, they said.
    Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy
conditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, with
ships fighting a losing battle to keep moving.
    In the coastal stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia, which
divides Finland and Sweden, the ice is up to one metre thick,
with drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrable
walls three metres high, Swedish coastguard officials said.
    Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but
a further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a
standstill, the officials said.

<TITLE>EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephanie Nebehay, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community EC and
Sovietled Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on
setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because
of Comecons refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the
EC, delegates said.
    Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of
a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30
years of mutual nonrecognition. John Maslen, head of the EC
delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session
"We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting."
    Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team
had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which
would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12nation EC.
    Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements
signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause
stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC
negotiator taking part in the threeday talks said "We wanted
the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no."
    A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was
made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be
necessary to complete the work.
    Any decision in principle to set up relations would require
approval by the Communitys Council of Ministers and by the
executive committee of Comecon.
    Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the
East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of todays session "We
have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not
on all questions."
    Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any
joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the
Community, he replied "This question is not contained in the
draft which our side presented."
    West German diplomats said they would insist on including
the clause on West Berlin in any ECComecon agreement.
    The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading
blocs here last September and the firstever direct talks
between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic
relations in January.
    The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite
nonrecognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five
billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half
the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of
Soviet oil imported by the EC.

<TITLE>OHIO EDISON ltOEC> SELLS 30 PCT OF NUCLEAR INTEREST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Ohio Edison Co said it has
completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct
interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.
    The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205
megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional
investors which leased it back to the company for a period of
about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.
    Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the
rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans
incurred for the retirement of highinterest longterm debt.
    Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said
the "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company
will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates
into savings for our customers."
    The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the
amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans
on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.
    It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the
investors because they could take quicker advantage of tax
benefits than the utility could.

<TITLE>GEODOME SETS IDAHO GOLD/SILVER MINE CONSTRUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAILEY, Idaho, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Geodome Resources Ltd said
following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Cos
Stearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and
preproduction stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County,
Idaho, as quickly as possible.
    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It
said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per
year, with highergrade ore being mined in the first three
years for a rapid payback of capital costs.
    It said the feasibility study calls for gold production
averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and
50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000
ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life.
    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with allnew equipment
and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm
said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner
but the associated mill by Geodome.
    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not
included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine
holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of
gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.
    Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of lowgrade
material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for
gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.
    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201
dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the
first three years, in constant dollars.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it
reached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir
Group Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of
USAir.
    Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir
stock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will
not do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to
USAir.
    TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly
interfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and
Piedmont Aviation Inc ltPIE>.
    TWA said the court agreement confirms previous
announcements by the company, in filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to
seek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock.
    As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous
temporary restraining order against TWA, the company said.
    TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between
them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23.
TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to
regulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger.
    In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also
included a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by
TWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a
voting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not
controlled by TWA or Icahn.

<TITLE>TREASURYS BAKER SEES INCREASED TAX COMPLIANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that over the longterm the tax reform bill and lower marginal
tax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bring
in additional revenue.
    In testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee
Baker said no savings in the Treasurys budgetary requirements
wil be achieved in the shortrun by the new tax law.
    "The tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reform
will not directly effect IRS enforcement activities until
financial year 1989 and 1990."
    He told the subcommittee that the Treasurys objective was
to strengthen the capability of the Internal Revenue Service to
promote tax compliance and generate revenue.
    He said they were seeking funds to increase staffing to
reduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts, reducing pending
tax litigation cases under appeal, and resolving unreported
income cases disclosed through a program that matches third
party documents to returns.
    "This request will continue our effort to build a stronger
and more credible deterrent against noncompliance with tax
laws," he said.
    Baker also told the subcommittee that the administration
would continue the efforts to improve the management of the
governments cash and credit, and its financial information.
     In addition a policy of full reimbursement to Federal
Reserve Banks for the fiscal agent services they provide in
marketing and maintaining Treasury securities will be
continued.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL STRIKES SPREAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, Zambia, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A  teachers strike has spread
from Lusaka to the whole of Zambia, and a walkout by nurses has
virtually paralyzed hospitals in the northern Copperbelt, the
stateowned Zambia Daily Mail newspaper said today.
    The teachers and nurses are demanding hefty pay raises,
including a 50 pct increase in basic salary. But their strike
action is unofficial, and the government has condemned the
stoppages, warning that they could lead to violence.
    The strikes broke out only three months after food riots in
the Copperbelt last December, which left 15 people dead.
    The stoppages began on Wednesday when 1,000 teachers in
Lusaka and 200 nurses in the northern town of Kitwe decided to
walk out in support of pay demands.

<TITLE>AMERICAN MOTORS ltAMO> BOARD MEETING ON TAKEOVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corps board of
directors is meeting this morning in New York to consider
Chrysler Corps ltC> 1.5 billion dlr takeover offer, an American
Motors spokesman said.
    The spokesman reiterated statements made earlier in the
week that the regularly scheduled meeting was being held.
    The spokesman would not comment on recurring speculation
that the board might receive a higher offer from Chrysler.
Analysts have said the fact that American Motors stock has
remained above the four dlrs a share Chrysler offer could lead
the larger company to raise its bid.
    The American Motors spokesman said he had not seen any
indication that a higher offer would be received from Chrysler,
although he added, "I dont know what the conversation is in
the meeting."
    He repeated statements made earlier in the week by the
automaker that todays meeting will probably not result in a
final decision on the Chrysler bid.
    "The board first apprised the proposal on the 11th of
March. I suspect there will be several more meetings after
this," the spokesman said.
    The meeting is expected to go through early afternoon.

<TITLE>BELGRADE UNIONS HIT PAY FREEZE, STRIKES SPREAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Belgrade trade union leaders have
joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia.
    Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions
council, said last night the government would be responsible
for the effects of the law imposing the wage freeze. The law,
enacted February 27 and remaining in force until July 1,
reimposed wage levels of the last quarter of 1986. Future pay
raises were pegged to productivity. The move triggered
resentment and widespread industrial unrest.
    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag
Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on
strike in Belgrade. The government has officially reported 70
strikes throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers
have hinted at more.

<TITLE>KEATING SEES LOWER AUSTRALIAN CURRENT DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said
he expects the countrys 1986/87 current account deficit to be
one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the
August budget. Keating told a financiers dinner that
Februarys 750 mln dlr deficit, against Januarys 1.23 billion,
was "in the groove" of the governments expectations.
    "We will probably bring the current account this year under
14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion
dollars less than we forecast in the budget," Keating said. "I am
sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year
... And a fall as proportion of GDP."
    Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account
deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures
showed an encouraging trend.
    Keating said the government would maintain responsible
economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an
election, because it would take time to stabilise Australias
80 billion dlr foreign debt.
    "We have to build the import competing sector back," he said.
"We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are
trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and
manufacturing."
    Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy
had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and
continued with wage restraint and deregulation.
    The Government would follow with spending cuts in its
economic statement on May 14, he said.

<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Sharp price hikes for food and fuel
planned by the government could provoke an open confrontation
with workers and endanger Polands fragile postSolidarity
stability, a government trade union leader has warned.
    Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the national trade
union alliance OPZZ, said the unions strong rejection of the
increases yesterday was prompted by the hostility of lowerpaid
workers.
    The authorities told the OPZZ on Tuesday that food prices
would rise by an average of 13 pct but ncreases for fuels 
including electricity and gas  would be much higher.
    They said wage increases would be limited to 12 pct in 1987
and that employers who breached the ceiling would be punished
through additional taxes.

<TITLE>TREASURYS BAKER SUPPORTS FED MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
in a newspaper interview that he supports the current course of
Federal Reserve Board monetary policy.
    "The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we are
concerned," Baker said in an interview with the New York Times.
    In the interview, Baker declined to comment about the
recent Paris accord among the six leading industrialized
democracies when he was asked why the U.S. agreed to stabilize
the dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a
record level last year.
    Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was "a subject
I prefer not to talk about."
    He said that if he explained why the U.S. agreed to help
maintain the dollar at current levels "I would of necessity end
up getting into some of the private agreements that support
such and agreement" on the dollar.
    Baker was optimistic about Brazil, which has stopped
interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign
commercial banks.
    "They are, after all, paying on time all the debt service
and principal on their official debts, having just rescheduled
with the Paris Club," Baker said in the newspaper interview.
    Baker said that Brazilian repreentatives had explained they
intented to pay their commercial bank debts in full but needed
time.

<TITLE>SONEX RESEARCH ltSONX> CUSTOM AUTO USES MORE GAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Sonex Research Inc said its
modified 1986 British Ford Escort passed the European emissions
test, but reported the engine consumed 35 pct more fuel than
the stock engine.
    Sonex said its engine is not equipped with a catalytic
converter and does not use exhaust gas recirculation or an
emission air pump. It said the company expected to realize a
reduced fuel economy, but is working on improving fuel
consumption.
    The company said after it installs the new fuel system, it
will retest the automobile.
    In a separate announcement, the company said it received
confirmation from the European Patent Office that Sonex
successfully defended its BETA European Patent from a
competitor.

<DATELINE>    Calgary, Alberta, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf Canada Corp said a
discharge of material at its Amauligak drilling site in the
Beaufort Sea caused no danger to the environment.
    Yesterday, the federal department of energy charged Gulf
Canada with eight counts of illegal dumping for discharging
powdered cement and drilling mud between September 23 and 30
last year.
    The charges carry a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count.
    Gulf said the governments charges relate to discharging
materials without a permit, not to environmental damage
resulting from the action.
    Gulf said it voluntarily informed appropriate government
officials when the material was discharged.
    The company also said none of the material was discharged
within 12 miles of the closest shoreline. It added that one of
the materials cited, barite, is a naturally occurring mineral
routinely discharged into the sea during drilling operations.

<TITLE>PUBCO ltPUBO> DECLARES DIVIDEND RIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Pubco Corp said its board declared a
dividend distribution of one common stock purchase right on
each outstanding share of Pubcos common stock.
    It said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one
share of common stock at an exercise price of three dlrs.
    The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 20 pct or more of Pubcos common stock or announces a
tender which would result in ownership by a person or group of
20 pct or more of the common stock, the company said.
    Pubco said it will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0.1
cts per right at any time before a 20 pct position has been
acquired and afterward in certain circumstances. It said the
exercise price will be substantially reduced in the event of an
acquisition of 25 pct or more of common stock.
    If Pubco is acquired in a merger or other transaction, each
right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the rights
thencurrent exercise price, a number of the acquiring
companys common shares having a market value at that time of
twice the rights exercise price, the company said.
    The dividend distribution will be made March 31, 1987,
payable to shareholders of record on that date. The rights will
expire ten years later on March 31, 1987, the company said.
    Pubco said the rights are not being distributed in response
to any specific effort to change control of Pubco, and the
board is not aware of any such effort.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Pacific Corp said it received
about 40 mln dlrs in cash from a surplus in the pension fund of
Hoover Plc, its U.K. subsidiary.
    As part of an agreement to refund the amount to the
company, Hoover employee and pensioner benefits have been
significantly enhanced, the companys annual report shows.
    In addition, Chicago Pacific said the remaining 110 mln
dlrs surplus funds will be kept in the Hoover pension fund and
will be invested so that the proceeds will eliminate or reduce
required future pension contributions for Hoover and its
employees as of December 31, 1986, it said.
    The 110 mln dlrs remaining surplus is reported as a
"restricted longterm investment" under current purchase
accounting requirements, according to the report.
    The settlement assures employees that their retirement
benefits will be adequately funded and provides for future
funding from the income received on this investment, it said.

<TITLE>VERTEX ltVETX> TO BUY COMPUTER TRANSCEIVER STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLIFTON, N.J., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Vertex Industries Inc and
ltComputer Transceiver Systems Inc> jointly announced an
agreement for Vertex to acquire a 60 pct interest in Computer
after it completes a proposed reorganization.
    Computer has been in reorganization proceedings under
chapter 11 since September 1986.
    The companies said the agreement would allow Computers
unsecured creditors and debenture holders to receive new stock
in exchange for exsiting debt, and for shareholders to receive
one new share of Computers stock for each four shares
previously held.
   
    The companies said the United States Bankruptcy court for

by Computers creditors and the court.
    Under the agreement, Vertex also said it would supply
Computer with 250,000 dlrs of operating funds, and arrange
renegotiation of its secured bank debt, among other things.

<TITLE>TREASURYS BAKER OPPOSES CLOSING BANK LOOPHOLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the administration still opposes Senate Banking Committee
legislation that would close a key loophole in federal bankinng
law.
    The loophole has spawned a proliferation of limited service
banks known as nonbank banks that can engage in risky
activities barred to traditional banks.
    Baker has been asked to support the legislation by Banking
Chairman William Proxmire DWisc.
    Proxmires panel approved closing the loophole in a bill
recapitalizing the thrift insurance fund.
    Baker said the administration supports moving a bill
through Congress that would address only the recapitalization
issue, for fear such "collateral provisions" as the
loopholeclosing measure would stall the bill.
    Proxmire later told reporters he backs the committee bill
with or without administration support.
    "Im going to push it through in any event," he said.
    The administration also opposes the committee bill on
grounds it bars new banking powers.
    The administration is a long time backer of banking
deregulation.

<TITLE>MORGAN GUARANTY SELLS FIRST REPACKAGED PERPETUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Guaranty Ltd, through a special
financing subsidiary, said it is issuing the first repackaging
of perpetual floating rate notes, consisting of a repackaging
of an outstanding WestPac Banking Corp security.
    Trading in perpetual floating rate notes, about 17 billion
dlrs of which are outstanding, has come to a virtual halt as
prices plunged. Because the securities never mature, there is
no way to price them properly unless there is a liquid twoway
market for them.
    Investors have been stuck with billions of dollars of notes
on their books that no one else will buy.
    Under terms of the offer, Morgan said it has set up a
specialpurpose financing company, Pacific Securities Co Ltd,
which will issue two separate securities. The unit becomes the
holder of 200 mln dlrs of Westpac floating rate notes.
    Morgan officials declined to disclose the level at which
Pacific  purchased the Westpac securities, although in late
February, they were quoted at 85 against an issue price of par.
    Pacific Securities will issue two instruments. The first is
a floating rate bond due March 29, 2002. The bond pays interest
at 50 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.
    While the initial Westpac issue offered investors only 15
basis points over LIBOR, Morgan Guaranty said WestPac has
agreed with Pacific Securities that it will pay investors the
remaining 35 basis points.
    Also, WestPac has agreed to redeem to floating rate notes
after 15 years.
    The other portion of the security consists of a zerocoupon
bond, also maturing at 2002, for which the investor pays 20
cents on the dollar. Morgan officials said that by 2002, the
effective yield will be a 20 pct return.
    However, Morgan officials said, holders of the zerocoupon
bonds will not be paid in cash when the securities mature.
    Instead, they will be paid in an equivalent amount of
zerocoupon Westpac perpetual floating rate notes.
    As part of the agreement, Pacific Securities has agreed to
place proceeds of the sale of the new securities on deposit at
WestPac and earnings from the deposit will be used to subsidise
the payment of the additional interest to investors.
    Also as part of the issue, there is an option for issuance
of a 70 mln dlr tap to be offered the following year.
    The tap will consist of 70 mln dlrs in floating rate notes
paying and an additional equivalent amount of zero coupon bonds
also at a deep discount of 20 cents on the dollar.
    Fees consist of a one pct selling concession and 0.50 pct
combined underwriting and management.
    Westpac itself has agreed to be colead manager of both
tranches and two small syndicates are being formed, Morgan
Guaranty said.

<TITLE>BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS CERTIFICATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Finland said it has
started dealings in banks certificates of deposits CDs with
immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own
paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.
    Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news
conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money
market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit
amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.
    "The recent introduction of threemonth money and these new
regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market
and the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said.
    Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these
were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank
of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,
they said.
    "The central bank for the first time has an instrument with
which it really can influence the price of money in this
country," one banker said.
    Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits
to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital
and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now
introduced if the limit is exceeded.
    Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finlands monetary
department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy
on the interbank market as an issuer of ownCDs.
    "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the
first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we
will issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters.
    He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a
threemonth maturity at first as the market was best developed
for paper of that maturity.
    The Bank of Finland introduced last December threemonth
credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank
and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional
overnight call money market.
    Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around
nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,
while threemonth credits have risen to three to four billion.
    On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade
in banks CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In
addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion
markka and Treasury Bills two billion.

<TITLE>U.S. FUTURES LEADER SEES TOKYO LIBERALIZING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan will liberalize rules
restricting their financial institutions ability to trade
foreign financial futures contracts within the next two years,
Leo Melamed, director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchanges,
CMEs, executive committee, said.
    Melamed, also the head of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, told
a press conference yesterday at the Futures Industry
Association convention that within the next year or two the
Japanese government is "going to lift the curtain on their
community of users" of futures markets.
    Currently, government restrictions prevent Japanese
citizens from trading futures or options contracts offshore
and converting the profits back into yen, according to Richard
Heckinger, CMEs vice president for international marketing.
    In addition, Japanese are not allowed to convert yen into
dollars for the purpose of trading futures contracts overseas,
he said.
    Melamed predicted the Nikkei stock average index future 
a priceweighted index future based on 225 Tokyo Stock Exchange
issues which is traded on the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange and mutually offset at the CME  would do much better
if Japanese financial institutions were able to use it.
    CME is waiting for approval from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to begin trading the Nikkei stock index
future in Chicago.
    "We will not do as well with that contract until or unless
the Japanese community, financial institutions, can utilize it
in Chicago," Melamed said.
    Melamed and Heckinger said they had no firm evidence that
Tokyo would liberalize futures trading rules, but sensed from
Japanese inquiries and visits a readiness to change.
    Next month, the CME is to open a Tokyo office to strengthen
the exchanges link to Japan.
    The managing director of the office will be Takeo Arakawa,
formerly of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Tokyo.
    Melamed said he hoped Arakawa would help the CME maintain a
competitive edge when Japan launches financial futures trading.
    Next month the Osaka exchange is set to begin trading a
stock index future, Heckinger said.
    "We are not going to let them the Japanese do what they
did to the American automobile industry. We want to be partners
with them," Melamed said.

<TITLE>CBT SEES LIFFE LINK OPERATING BY EARLY 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A trading link between the
Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, and the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, LIFFE, should be in operation by
the beginning of next year, CBT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said.
    "It could be the end of this year or the beginning of next
year that the linkage could become operational," Mahlmann told
the Futures Industry Association.
    The two exchanges signed a memorandum of understanding on
February 9 calling for the eventual establishment of a mutual
offset clearing system that would allow traders to initiate
positions on one exchange and liquidate them on the other.
    Mahlmann said the contracts involved in the link could
include British gilts, Eurobonds, Japanese government bonds,
foreign currencies and the Financial TimesStock Exchange 100
stock index.

<TITLE>MCDONALDS ltMCD> UP ON REAFFIRMED RECOMMENDATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The stock of McDonalds Corp rose
sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock, traders
said.
    McDonalds, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose
15/8 to 773/8.
    "Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,"
Lee said, "and the stock is trading below the market multiple."
He said "not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual
earnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade
at less than the market multiple."
    Analyst Lee said "the introduction of a new line of salads
this spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze
into bathing suits, should boost sales."
    He also noted that "the average McDonalds does about 1.369
mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a
year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for
the average Wendys." Since it cost about the same to build a
single store for any one of these chains, he said, "McDonalds
can well justify their expansion."
    Lee expects McDonalds to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986
and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.

<TITLE>MEXICO SIGNS 7.7 BILLION DLR LOAN AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Mexican officials and representatives
of about 360 creditor banks worldwide started to sign
agreements for 7.7 billion dlrs in new loans, Citibank said as
cochairman of Mexicos bank advisory committee.
    The package, which was agreed in principle with the
committee last October 16, is built on a core loan of six
billion dlrs, of which five billion dlrs will be lent for 12
years with five years grace.
    The remaining one billion dlrs is in the form of a
cofinancing with the World Bank, which will guarantee 500 mln
dlrs. This loan is for 15 years with nine years grace.
    The package also includes two contingency facilities
totalling 1.7 billion dlrs.
    One is a growthcontingency cofinancing with the World
Bank for 500 mln dlrs, of which half will be guaranteed by the
World Bank.
    The loan may be drawn to fund highpriority investment
projects if Mexican economic growth fails to reach certain
growth targets for the first quarter of 1987.
    Disbursements would be for 12 years with seven years
grace. Bankers said they expect the loan, which is available
until March 1988, will be drawn down.    
    The second contingency facility, for 1.2 billion dlrs, is
designed to support investment in the public and private
sectors.
    The loan may be drawn down until April 1988 but only if
Mexico experiences a shortfall in publicsector external
receipts and provided that Mexico first qualifies for drawings
under a 600 mln sdr oilcontigency facility from the
International Monetary Fund.
    This IMF loan would be triggered if the price of oil falls
below nine dlrs a barrel for three months.
    Because of the level of public sector external receipts in
the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987,
Mexico will not draw the first two tranches of the continency
facility, totalling 451 mln dlrs, Citibank said.
    As previously reported, bank commitments to the new money
package will also be reduced by 250 mln dlrs, representing the
interest payments that Mexico will save this year, thanks to
the reduced spread on the rescheduling.
    Under the rescheduling, Mexico is restructuring 43.7
billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt over 20 years with
seven years grace.
    Maturities on another 8.6 billion dlrs of loans granted in
1983 and 1984 will remain the same. The interest rate will be
at 13/16 pct over Eurodollar deposit rates  the margin that
applies to the entire package.
    Rounding out the deal, the banks have agreed to prolong six
billion dlrs of trade lines and to refinance some 10 billion
dlrs of privatesector debt that comes under the Mexican
governments exchangeguarantee scheme, Ficorca.
    The size of the package thus comes to about 76 billion
dlrs, the largest ever assembled in the international credit
markets, Citibank said.
    The loan is still only 99 pct subscribed and the loan books
will be kept open for several more weeks to round up the final
100 mln dlrs and the approximately 60 banks that have so far
refused to join the deal.

<TITLE>ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Companies will henceforth be able to own
stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a "dominant"
holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
reflected the "need to safeguard the principle of separation
between banks and nonfinancial concerns."
    It did not quantify what might constitute a "dominant"
holding.
    The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
by banks in companies or other banks.
    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
of the banks capital must not exceed defined limits.
    The value of credits given cannot exceed either onefifth
of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
twofifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
group or individual concerned.
    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
excluded from the conditions.
    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
five pct or more of the banks capital are not given privileged
treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
banks consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
indirectly.
    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
of the banks stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
predefined limits.
    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

<TITLE>GE ltGE> TO RESEARCH COALFIRED GAS TURBINE POWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EVENDALE, Ohio, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric Co said its
researchers will investigate the potential of a gas turbine
powered by the combustion gases of burning coal.
    The company said the research is part of a fiveyear, 19.1
mln dlr program supported by the U.S. Energy Departments
Morgantown Energy Technology Center. The center is expected to
put up 15 mln dlrs of the cost while GE contributes equipment
and services valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, New York State contributes
1.1 mln dlrs and Norfolk Southern Corp ltNSC> adding 1.0 mln
dlrs.
    Rather than using the conventional gas turbine fuels,
distillate oil or natural gas, GE said, the program will look
at the feasability of powering a turbine with coal/water slurry
 a mixture of water and finely ground coal particles from
which most of the ash has been removed.
    Besides using a cheaper fuel, the company said, such a
system would also be less expensive to build than conventional
coal plants which require a boiler in which coal heats water to
make steam to drive a turbine or a coal gasifier which converts
to coal into gas, which is then burned to power a turbine.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION ltFBT></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Julie Vorman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>First City Bancorporations sale of 54
mln dlrs in oil loans to PrudentialBache should significantly
reduce its energy problems, but the banks losses are still
virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.
    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so
First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman
James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more
of the banks remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oilrelated loans
to raise cash.
    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and
to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had
already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a
loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those
categories.
    The loans were purchased by Prudential Baches Energy
Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90
mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.
    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn
in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986
and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other
capital assistance. The Houstonbased banks nonperforming
assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln
dlrs at the end of 1985
    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in
the troubled bank unless government assistance is available.
    "Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a
substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of
itself wont make the company look better to a potential
buyer," said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,
Crisanti and Maffei Inc.
    "It does reduce the banks exposure in energy loans and 54
mln dlrs is a substantial amount," Archibold said, "but the
deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans."
    Of First Citys total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about
14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or
suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by
its past status as one of the nations top lenders to oil and
gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late
1970s and early 1980s.
    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential
came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to
loan money to "more venturesome" oil borrowers that promised a
higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from
First Citys lead bank in Houston.
    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said
the sale of the package of energy loans was the first
encouraging news from First City in months.
    "Its not going to solve all of First Citys problems but
its a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them
to sell additional loans," Kotowski said. "Prudential can fund
these things more cheaply than First City and theres an
incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as
values are depressed"
    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the
banks strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to
total loans. "This move, which we believe is the first
transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to
make it without suffering a loss."

<TITLE>AUDIO/VIDEO ltAVA> SUES OVER CYCLOPS ltCYL> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
has filed suit against ltDixons Group PLC>, Cyclops Corp,
Alleghany Corp ltY> and others in connection with Dixons
recently completed tender offer in which it raised its
ownership of Cyclops to 56 pct.
    The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Ohio, seeks a temporary restraining
order and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10
business days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously
tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.
    The company said the order and injunction would also
prohibit Dixons from exercising a "lockup" option granted it by
Cyclops and prohibit Dixons for 10 business days from
attempting to exercise any control over Cyclops.
    Audio/Video said the suit also requests the court to order
Cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for
Cyclops all information given to Dixons.
    Audio/Video and Citicorp ltCCI> have been tendering for all
Cyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but
said it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain
circumstances.  Dixons offered 90.25 dlrs in its tender.
    In February Alleghany agreed to buy Cyclops steel and
nonresidential construction business for 111.6 mln dlrs in cash
and the assumption of liabilities.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltDixons Group PLC> said the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has authorized, but not
commenced, the filing of an action against it concerning its
waiver of a condition in its tender offer for Cyclops Corp.
    Dixons has offered to buy about 80 pct of Cyclops shares.
The SEC action deals with a waiver by Dixons of a condition in
the tender offer which was made without an appropriate

    Dixons also said it is currently discussing the matter with
the SEC. The SEC has a standing policy of never confirming
or denying investigations or upcoming legal action.

<TITLE>FDA OKAYS BURROUGHS WELLCOME AZT AS AIDS TREATMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Food and Drug Administration has
approved Burroughs Wellcome Cos AZT as a treatment to help
certain AIDS patients, including those with advancedAIDS
related complex.
    The drug is the first approved treatment for AIDS in the
U.S. AZT or azidothymidine will be marketed as Retrovir by the
company, the U.S. arm of Britains ltWellcome PLC>.
    Because of its limited supply, the FDA said the drug will
be restricted initially to those patients with AIDS or
AIDSrelated complex with severely depressed immunity or a
history of Pnumocystis carinii, pneumonia.
    "Todays approval marks an important step but by no means a
final victory against our ongoing war against AIDS," said Dr
Robert E. Windom, assistant secretary for health at the Public
Health Service.
    He noted that available clinical data were sufficient for
approving the use of Retrovir only for certain indications and
not for all AIDS associated conditions.
    Nevertheless, Windom said todays action means that
significant medical relief will be available to thousands of
those afflicted with the disease.
    "Retrovir is not a cure but it has demonstrated ability to
improve the shortterm survival of AIDS patients with recently
diagnosed PCP Pneumomystis carinii pneumonia and certain
patients with advanced ARC AIDSrelated complex," said
Windom.
    Advanced AIDS related complex is a condition that
frequently precedes and develops within a short time into
fullscale acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
    As of March 16, there were 32,825 AIDS cases reported
nationwide, with more than 16,000 deaths.
    The Public Health Agency said advanced ARC patients have
symptoms that include weight loss, persistent fever and
diarrhea, and less severe infections such as oral thrush and
herpes infections.
    The federal agency said that AIDS patients who are expected
to qualify for retrovir treatment are those who have serious
opportunistic infections associated with AIDS and those with
advanced AIDS related complex.
    It is estimated that about two to three times as many
Americans may suffer from advanced ARC as from AIDS.
    Burroughs Wellcome, of Research Triangle Park, N.C., has
scheduled a press conference for Monday in New York where it
will discuss what patients will quality for treatment. The
company has said that a years treatment with the drug would
cost 8,000 dlrs to 10,000 dlrs.
    Burroughs has also said that it has adequate supplies of
the drug for the most seriously ill patients, and will have
supplies for a minimum of 30,000 patients and probably more by
the end of the year.
    Retrovirs approval was expected as a panel of expert
medical advisers to the FDA recommended in January that the
drug be licensed for sale even though there were gaps in
understanding the drugs effectiveness.
    The panel said the drug could prolong the lives of certain
AIDS patients but it also caused severe side effects such as
anemia and other blood problems.
    Due to the extraordinary situation surrounding AIDS, a
fatal disease reaching what some health officials say is
epidemic proportions, Windom said the FDA has moved in near
record timefour monthsto approve the drug.
    AZT, derived from herring sperm, was created in the 1960s
by Jerome P. Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as an
anticancer agent.
    Meanwhile in London, dealers said Wellcome shares rose to
497p in response, up from last nights close of 457p.
    But pharmaceutical analyst Mark Clark of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd said the new drugs share of the market may not be as a
high as expected since it had very severe side effects.
    "It is not a cure and the side effects are so bad it is
unlikely that someone could support a full years treatment," he
said. "There are also a whole host of other drugs likely to come
onto the market quite soon."
    Last week the drug was approved for marketing in the U.K.

<TITLE>REAGAN TO VETO 87.5 BILLION DLR HIGHWAY BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said he will veto
an 87.5 billion dlr highway and transit bill, citing his
commitment to hold to spending cuts to meet budget deficit
reduction goals.
    "I am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is in
the bill as it emerged from a HouseSenate conference
committee," he said in a statement.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan had
reservations on 152 socalled demonstration highway projects
and on the amount for transit projects.
    The bill called for transit projects totalling 17.8 billion
dlrs, compared to 8.7 billion proposed by the administration.
    Fitzwater said, however, that Reagan supported the right of
states to raise the highway speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph,
a provision that is also in the legislation.

<TITLE>COMEX CONSIDERING NEW FUTURES CONTRACTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Exchange Inc,
COMEX, is researching the possibility of offering futures
contracts on foreign currency swaps and Ginnie Mae repurchase
agreements, a COMEX consultant said.
    Kurt Dew, president of Risk Analysis Systems, said the idea
was on the drawing board at the staff level and not near
realization.
    Dew said the contracts would be logical successors to two
contracts already proposed by the exchange  futures on
interest rate swaps and on Treasury repurchase agreements, or
repos.
    Regulations recently proposed by federal bank regulators
could enhance the attractiveness of futures contracts on
currency swaps, he said.
    Those regulations would require banks to allocate a certain
share of its capital to currency swaps, Dew said. Futures on
currency swaps would not require capital allocation.
    A futures market in Government National Mortgage
Association Ginnie Mae repos would help investors outside the
circle of primary dealers get the best possible price, Dew
said.
    Dew emphasized that the COMEX board had not yet considered
the contracts.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Analyst Thomas McCrann of Merrill
Lynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of Wang
Laboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cutting
campaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third
quarter ending in March.
    Wang was the most actively traded stock on the American
Stock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 165/8.
    McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where they
were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result,
the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be
less than had been expected."
    McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings
per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.
    He said for the year, however, the company should report a
loss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35
cts a share a year ago.

<TITLE>JAPAN, BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless Plc ltCAWL.L> is
resisting attempts to merge two Japanbased telecommunications
firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a
change in those plans, a company executive said.
    Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of
the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share
to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy
Jonathan Solomon told reporters.
    That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful
business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the
Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of
protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign
firms from a meaningful position in the market.
    Pacific Telesis Group ltPAC.N> of the United States also
holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,
ltInternational Digital Communications Inc> IDC.
    Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have
written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.
    A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also
expressed opposition to the merger, he said.
    The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again
that it sees no need for two competitors to ltKokusai Denshin
Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls
from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign
shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.
    In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met
Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange
the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.
    At stake is C and Ws 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre
optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its
global network.
    "C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as
application and other procedures," said Watanabe, who is also
chairman of ltTokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese
side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left
with the new firm, after the merger.
    "These decisions on the merger were made in consideration
of Japans economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we
are not a colony or something," said Watanabe.

slowed in February after Januarys sharp rise but the trend is
still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with
statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,
shortterm time deposits fell after expanding unusually
strongly in January.
    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings
of German nonbanks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.
    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 71/2 pct.
    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time
deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash
and sight deposits, rose seven pct.
    International transactions of nonbanks again led to a
significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.
    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1
billion marks in February, little changed from Januarys rise.
    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the
inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.
    Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.
    A sharp drop in shortterm company credits, which reflected
the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in
longterm credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.
    At the end of February total bank credits to the private
sector were 41/2 pct above the February 1986 level.
    The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.
    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
banks and the Bundesbank.
    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
supply growth to a larger extent than in January.
    A total of 7.7 billion marks in longterm funds was placed
with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.

rating on Delmarva Power and Light Co first mortgage bonds to
DP3 middle AA from DP2 high AA and on preferred stock to

    The rating change reflects expectations of lower fixed

    An interim cut in electric rates in Delaware and Maryland
to reflect a lower allowed return on equity was made in the
second half of 1986. A final decision is expected in April.

<TITLE> EC SAYS U.S. BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZODUPONT ROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission has
charged the United States with breaking international trade
rules by excluding Dutchmade fibres from the U.S. Market and
said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.
    In the latest of a series of trade disputes with
Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of
the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because it discriminated
against imported products in favour of domesticallyproduced
goods.
    The Commission said it would ask Genevabased GATT to rule
on whether the section in question, which officials said had
proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.
    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to
bring the disputed section into line with international rules.
    The executives decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
to it by the Dutch company Akzo ltAKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"
synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because
of charges by the U.S. Firm ltDupont> that the fibres violate
the American companys patents.
    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.
International Trade Commission ITC, was discriminatory and
incompatible with GATT provisions.
    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.
    "Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable
than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
produced in the United States," it said in a statement.

<TITLE>HOUSTON METALS MINE YIELDS POSITIVE RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltHouston Metals Corp> said the
the first phase of the underground rehabilitation, extensive
drilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine has
yielded positive results.
    Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and
2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established ore
deposits in the following ranges copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,
lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63
pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium
93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.
    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25
diamonddrilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800
ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at
10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.
    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level
returned similar values, the company said.
    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from
representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial
feasability of producing a zinc and a copperlead concentrate.
    Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals have
recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recovered
from better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium have
recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the
zinc concentrate.
    The companys 1987 program of diamond drilling, underground
drifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start on
April.
    Houston Metals said it has a 60 pct interest in the Silver
Queen mines.
    It added that funds for the program have been provided by
First Exploration Fund, a Canadian limited partnership
sponsored by Merrill Lynch Canada Inc and Dominion Securities
Inc.

<TITLE>PRESSURE BUILDS ON THATCHER TO CALL ELECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
came under fresh pressure for an early election today as
financial indicators bolstered the governments forecasts of a
boom in the economy following the budget earlier this week.
    Two of the countrys leading lending institutions announced
cuts in home loans rates following Wednesdays cut in interest
rates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent.
    Analysts said todays reduction by Abbey National from
12.75 pct to 11.25, and one by the Halifax Building Society
from 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would be
followed by other main institutions.
   One financial analyst commented "I imagine the Abbey
National is being toasted in Downing Street the prime
ministers residence but not in the boardrooms of other big
societies."
    Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Finance Minister Nigel Lawson in his budget last
Tuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatchers
rightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and the
centrist Alliance, they said pressure was now building up on
Thatcher to call a general election as early as June.
    Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the form
of a continuing drop in the number of unemployed, with
government minister predicting that it would fall below the
three million mark before long.

200,000 dlrs.
    It also announced its president, J.R.Moman, resigned last

other organizations that have expressed interest in investing

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltBanque de lUnion Europeenne> said it
signed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Unions central
bank ltGosbank>, and Foreign Trade Bank ltVneshtorgbank>, with
the aim of creating a joint financial holding under new Soviet
joint venture laws.
    JeanPaul Dessertine, international director at BUE, said
the function of the proposed joint financial group, would be to
help set up, with consulting and financial services, other
FrancoSoviet, mainly industrial, joint ventures.
    Some protocols of intent have already been signed but no
joint venture contracts have been finalised under the new laws.
    Dessertine said a joint working party would on April 15
begin consulting with companies interested in making joint
ventures, and work to set up the joint financial holding.
    Citing the mixed results of joint ventures set up in the
past between western and East European countries, he said
    "This is a wager on the evolution of the Soviet Union, and
on how far new reforms will be applied."
    Other parties to the cooperation protocol are ltBanque
Commerciale pour lEurope du Nord>, a French subsidiary of
Gosbank, and ltCompagnie Financiere de Credit Industriel et
Commercial>, the parent company of BUE.

    Also left unchanged were Standard Chartered Banks ratings
for shortterm deposits.
    Although Moodys cited Standard Chartered Banks
longstanding position in a number of regional markets and
improved risk control procedures, it pointed out that the bank
still lacks the stabilizing effect of a more significant
presence in the U.K. market.
    The rating agency reiterated that it is concerned about the
relative levels of risk in the banks widely dispersed asset
portfolio.

said it will allow USAIR Group to acquire up to 51 pct of
Piedmont Aviation ltPIE> voting stocks pending final approval of
the proposed merger of the two airlines.
    The agency said the stock would have to be held in a voting

    The spokesman said the firm had asked the transporation

<TITLE>USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Department is not
considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted
county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.
    "We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments
or changes in our pricing," said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant
deputy administrator for commodity operations.
    U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week
USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at
the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted
prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.
    But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.
    "If people are suggesting that we are going to make
wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," he
said.
    Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of
implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.
    "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide
structure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we become
convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate
adjustments will be made."
    Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDAs
price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior
markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge
freight rates.
    He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph
Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and
will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.
    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that
meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn
premiums.
    He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price
margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and
that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or
decrease.
    The USDA official also said that only those counties that
use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the
high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.
    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which
allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space
and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted
the idea.
    He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and
that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be
emptied by the end of March.

<TITLE>GATT TO DEBATE U.S. CHARGES OF AIRBUS SUBSIDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Will pursue its complaint that
European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie
aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft
committee, a GATT spokesman said today.
    The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the
aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade GATT during a special twoday session ending today.
GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.
    The 20member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.
Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then
holding a special session in July, trade officials said.
    "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador of
the 12member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters.
"The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels."
    U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what
they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a
visit to European capitals in February.
    In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,
Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and
the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.
    The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules
laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.
    Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to
purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines
during the special session and asked the committee to confirm
its view.
    Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views
would be considered during the informal consultations but the
Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against
American civil aircraft practices.
    Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such
broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil
aircraft accord needed renegotiating. All these matters would
be considered during the informal meetings.

<TITLE>UK OFFICIAL SEES TRANSATLANTIC AIR TRAFFIC RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Minister for Aviation Michael
Spicer said transatlantic traffic should increase at least five
pct this year, after dropping nearly six pct last year.
    "We expect at least a five pct increase and it may exceed
that, reaching at least the peak levels of 1985," Spicer said
at a press conference.
    The figures refer to air traffic between North America and
Europe.
    Spicer also said transport ministers of the European
Community meeting next week are expected to agree on
liberalizing air traffic regulations in Europe.
    Spicer said fears of terrorism dissuaded Americans from
traveling to Europe last year, resulting in pent up demand that
will be released this year.
    He said the ministers, scheduled to meet in Brussels Monday
and Tuesday, should agree on allowing more than one airline to
fly particular routes between European cities, removing some
fare restrictions and easing capacity restrictions.
    Spicer also said he has asked U.S. officials to consider
allowing investment in U.S. carriers, particularly in smaller
commuter airlines, by foreign companies. He also wants U.S.
officials to allow British carriers to fly more freely between
U.S. destinations.

<TITLE>LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A panel of four leading economists
told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will
need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit
declines.
    C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department
official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting
countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S.
demand for imports is expected to fall.
    "They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade
surplus falls," or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten
said.
    Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169
billion dlrs last year, will fall 3040 billion dlrs a year for
the next two years as a result of the dollars 3540 pct
decline since September 1985.
    The government should intervene to push the dollar down
further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement
in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced
and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.
    Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for
the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The
Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries
provided only for a pause in its decline, he said.
    Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of
lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency
misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and
unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.
    John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested
foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from
the U.S. trade deficit fall.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE BUDGET WRITING PROCESS COLLAPSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Rep William Gray DPa, Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, abruptly canceled the committees
budget writing process when Republican members said they would
continue a vote strike begun yesterday.
    "Im not going to continue a markup in which my Republican
colleagues wont participate," Gray told reporters.
    He said he asked Republicans to tell him by Monday whether
they would vote in future open sessions.
    If they choose not to, he threatened to again draft a
budget behind closed doors with only Democrats present, as had
been done the previous two years.
    "If they do not want to participate in an open process ...
then I will make a decision as to how the Democrats will
proceed," Gray said.
    "If there is not possibility of Republican participation, I
will go back to what weve done in the past," he said.
    Republicans yesterday had voted "present" in a series of
committee votes on fiscal 1988 defense spending.
    The Republicans had said they were protesting the
Democrats failure to present alternatives to President
Reagans budget.

<TITLE>UNIQUE EXPORT FINANCING BEING ARRANGED FOR MEXICO</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A single purpose company, ltItalfunding
Ltd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds on
the international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs of
Mexicos official debt to Italy at very attractive rates,
Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd said as lead manager and arranger.
    The transaction will be accomplished by Italfunding
obtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market and
then using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amount
to Mexico. The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, the
official Italian export credit agency.
    Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the
past to help refinance export credits for other indebted
countries, such as Brazil and Ecuador.
    The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a
floating rate note. This transaction makes use of another
sector of the capital markets  that for shortterm note
facilities  to finance a medium term credit.
    The financing is being arranged in connection with a
bilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this year
to refinance Mexicos official debt to Italy.
    The bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling
agreement reached last September of Mexicos official debt to
the Paris Club of western creditor governments.
    The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broadbased
rescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexicos
foreign debt.
    That package  heralded as the first to incorporate all
aspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakers plan to aid
indebted countries  included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which
was signed today in New York.
     The new financing for
Italfunding, being syndicated among about five major
international banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving
facility with an average life of seven years and the facility
will fund the loan.
    All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted
outline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
    Banking sources noted that the use of a specialpurpose
vehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractive
financing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the London
Interbank Offered Rate Libor.
    The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of
13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.
    This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in
this case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply
on the international markets. At the same time, the deal
benefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on
the note facility, which is pure Italian risk.
    The bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged
in Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would have
been higher since the Italian banks would use a different
source of funding.

<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Proposed federal regulations
governing the sale of foreign futures and options contracts to
U.S. citizens would strap U.S. exchanges, an official of the
Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, said.
    Frederick Grede, CBT vice president of administration and
planning, told the Futures Industry Association that rules
proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC,
would "handicap the ability of U.S. exchanges and futures
commission merchants to compete internationally."
    The CFTC rules generally would require additional
registration and disclosure.
    Grede said that speculative positions, hedging and
aggregation do not exist on most overseas exchanges, and that
the regulations would impose onerous requirements relating to
the segregation of customer funds.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips, acknowledging that the
proposal was "controversial," said the commission would
consider revising the proposals.

<TITLE>WESTPAC PERPETUAL FRN NO INSTANT CURE, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Guaranty Ltds novel and complex
repackaging of Westpac Banking Corps perpetual floating rate
note FRN may attract some investors, but is unlikely to aid
current holders of the Westpac securities or the FRN market,
FRN traders said.
    "It actually does nothing for anyone who has been stuffed
and right now, thats the problem," said a trader at one U.K.
Clearing bank that has also issued its own perpetuals.
    Trading in perpetual issues, which pay interest but never
mature, has come to a virtual halt. Prices have fallen so far
that only about five firms still make markets in them.
    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now the
property of a newly formed singlepurpose finance subsidiary,
Pacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for the
actual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85
cents on the dollar, at most, traders said.
    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class of
investor for the notes and take the old issues off their books
without registering a loss, the traders said.
    "The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan," a trader
said.
    Meanwhile, the endholders of perpetual notes, most of whom
are Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them by
yearend, now a week away.
    From Morgans point of view, the repackaging does aid the
present holders of the notes as well as offering value to a new
class of investors.
    "At least weve put a floor under the price of the notes.
Weve created a way to set a real value for them," one Morgan
official said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,
another plan to repackage the Westpac securities.
    Morgans holdings of Westpac paper create special problems
for it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings of
the primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, it
is crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.
    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of the
repackaged securities  which Westpac has offered to redeem
for cash in 15 years  does have real value.
    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highest
rate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually any
newly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.
    However, the other portion of the security, in which the
investor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15year
bond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumes
a market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.
    The zerocoupon portion could provide value for an account
which for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, the
traders said. In the 15year period between the time the note
is purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.
    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like an
ordinary zerocoupon bond. Instead, the investor receives one
of the Westpac perpetual floaters.

    The order was issued as part of a settlement of FTC charges
that Coopers merger with GardnerDenver Co would lessen
competion and increase concentration in the gas compressor and
industrial air tool industries, the FTC said.
    The order requires that, until 1989, Cooper must get FTC

<TITLE>SWISS PAVING WAY TO INDEX FUTURES, OPTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland expects to launch
fully computerized trading of financial futures and options in
the near future, a senior Swiss official said.
    Alexis Lautenberg, minister for economic and financial
services at the Department of Foreign Affairs, said a stock
index based on issues traded on the three major Swiss exchanges
is expected to be completed this month, marking "an important
step towards the introduction of an option market and index
futures."
    Trading of options will begin next year "with more than a
dozen of the most actively traded shares ... and nonvoting
equities," he told the Futures Industry Association.
    The Swiss envision requiring dealers to handle transactions
on the computerized system and market makers to trade specific
equities, Lautenberg said.
    The Swiss official also said there would be limits on the
positions and exercise of option rights and that firms would
have to comply with minimum capital requirements under Swiss
banking law.
    He also said "intensive consultations" were under way with
a view toward allowing profits earned from traded options and
financial futures to be considered capital gains.
    "It would follow that only when a buyer would exercise his
option right by realizing a physical transaction would the
stamp duty, or securities tax, be levied," Lautenberg said.

<TITLE>SWISS BANKS MEET CHURCHES OVER S. AFRICA LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss banks are holding talks with
Protestant and Roman Catholic officials to hear church
complaints about lending to South Africa, the Swiss Bankers
Association said.
    In a statement the Association said the parties had
disagreed over economic sanctions.
    But all participants  representatives of the three
biggest Swiss banks, the Bankers Association itself, the
churches and church charities  agreed to condemn South
Africas apartheid policy both publicly and in contacts with
business and government offices there.
    After two private sessions last August and on March 10,
they agreed the meetings should continue.
    Swiss banks are criticised by the churches who say they are
in effect lending support to the South African government.
    The banks assured the churchmen that their lending had
declined substantially last year and that they had no intention
of building it up as banks from other countries withdrew.
    Pius Haffner of the Catholic charity Justitia et Pax told
Reuters, "It is at least a small step forward when the banks say
publicly they will not jump in when other banks pull out."

<TITLE>FTC URGES VETO OF GEORGIA GASOLINE STATION BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Trade Commission said
its staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that
would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating
retail gasoline stations.
    The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil
refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic
practices against franchised dealers.
    But the FTC said fears of refinerowned stations as part of
a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded.
It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would
force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists.

<TITLE>PAN AMS ltPN> MAIN UNIT TO REPORT SMALLER LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Pan Am Corp said its largest division,
the Atlantic, will report a first quarter loss that will be
substantially lower than that reported a year ago.
    In the 1986 1st qtr, Pan Am reported a net loss of 118.4
mln dlrs, which included foreign exchange losses of 19.3 mln.
The company did not say how much the Atlantic division lost.
    Pan Am also said it is encouraged by passenger traffic
results so far this year as well as booking trends.
    In January and February, the airline said total systemwide
revenue passenger miles were up five pct and 11 pct,
respectively, over the same months last year.
    It also said that based on current trends, its largest
division should report vastly improved secondquarter traffic
compared to last year, which resulted in a load factor of 45.7
pct for the second quarter of 1986.
    Pan Am also said its principal subsidiary, Pan American
World Airways, had a 1986 net loss of 469.3 mln dlrs, compared
with a profit of 38.7 mln dlrs in 1985, which included a gain
of 341 mln dlrs for the sale of its Pacific Division. It said
the airlines operating loss for the year was 325.5 mln dlrs
compared with a operating profit of 196.5 mln dlrs in 1985.

<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, OHio, march 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Cook United INc said it expects
to report a loss a loss of 16 mln dlrs, before an extraordinary
credit of 44 mln dlrs resulting from its Chapter 11
reorganization, on sales of 217 mln dlrs for the year ended
January 31, 1987.
    For 1986, Cook reported a loss of 30.8 mln dlrs on sales of
257 mln dlrs for the prior year.
    Cook also said it began preliminary talks with private
investors looking to buy a stock position in order to provide
Cook with additional cash and assist its posture in its
negotation with its banks.
    Cook is negotiating with its bank lenders and private
sources for a borrowing facility to relieve its current working
capital requirements.
    Cook said it believes the reasons for its losses since
OCtober have been identified and are mostly nonrecurring.
    Shutting down 12 unprofitable stores since November has   
effectuated cost controls and improved merchandising, it said.
    It anticipates the turnaround will contine and that
profitability with be restored. Cook now operates a total of 29
stores.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Endotronics Inc said it is the
target of a formal private investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
    The company also said its independent accounts, Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell and Co, served notice that its report on
Endotronics financial statements as of Sept 30, 1986 and for
the year then ended should no longer be relied upon.
    Endotronics said the notice from its accountants stated 
"we cannot satisfy ourselves as to the true facts of the
situation to a degree necessary to continue to be associated
with such consolidated financial statements."
    Endotronics recently reported that it was reviewing the
need to establish a reserve for all or a portion of
approximately 3,686,000 dlrs in overdue accounts receivable and
to assess the impact, if any, on prior period financial
statements in light of a dispute with one of its Japanese
distributors over payment of the overdue accounts.
    Endotronics said it was providing documentation to the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with that
agencys investigation.
    It also said Michael Gruenberg resigned from the companys

<TITLE>UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A new International Natural Rubber
Agreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations
Conference today.
    The new accord is due to replace the current one, which
expires in October.
    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the
formal adoption represented "a historic moment."
    The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented
the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.
Xuto described the negotiations as "by no means easy, and we
often faced problems."
    The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when
ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net
exports and 75 pct of net imports.
    The new INRA will enter into force definitively when
governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and
80 pct of net imports have ratified it.
    It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31
this year.
    It is expected that provisional entry into force will take
at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said.
    During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock
operations will be suspended, but the International Natural
Rubber Council will remain in place.
    Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its
successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and
consumers of natural rubber over the long term.
    Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto
added. He also praised "the spirit of give and take that
prevailed throughout this session."
    Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,
said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality
of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as
it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the
1970s.
    Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis
of predictable stable prices is "a vital consideration for
multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming
countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously
concerned about security of the rubber supply."
    He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had
served the purpose for which it was created.
    Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession
to the new pact "to avoid an undue gap between the old and the
new.
    Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,
agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.
    But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers
had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.
    He added that the adoption of the new agreement "attests to
the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry."

<TITLE>ATT ltT> CHAIRMAN SAYS DIVIDEND WILL NOT BE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co does
not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a
share on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman.
    "It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so
that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the
business cycle," Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.
    "We see no reason to change that policy," he said.
    Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said
the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid
in dividends by increasing earnings.
    Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its
common dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth
quarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts
a share for the full year.
    The loss included a onetime restructuring charge of 1.7
billion dlrs.
    Olson said he expects ATTs cash flow to remain strong
despite the poor earnings.

<TITLE>MAJOR TIN CENTERS PARALYSED BOLIVIA UNION SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LA PAZ, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A strike by 9,000 miners employed by the
state corporation Comibol has paralysed tin production in the
major centers of Huanuni, Corocoro, Siglo, Catavi and Colquiri,
the Conflicts Secretary of the Bolivian Miners Federation,
Cristobal Aranibar, told Reuters.
     The strike began at midnight to press demands for higher
wages and more funds for the nationalised mining industry.
     The miners federation left the door open to negotiations
with the government but "only if the authorities show their
intention to find solution to our demands", Aranibar said.
    The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro, faced
with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has
said the miners strike was part of a campaign to discredit it
during the visit of West German president, Richard von
Weizsaecker, who arrives today for a fourday official visit.
    The government froze salaries as part of its efforts to
pull Bolivia out of a deep economic crisis. According to
central bank forecasts inflation will reach an annual 10 pct
rate versus up to 20,000 pct in 1985.
     In addition to the miners strike, about 1,000 railway
factory workers of the bolivian labour organization COB began
a second day of a hunger strike in the countrys main cities to
press for substantial wage increases, a union leader said.

<TITLE>ALLIEDLYONS SEES HIRAM WALKER PROFITS RISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltAlliedLyons PLC> sees rising profits
from 51pctowned liquor producer Hiram WalkerGooderham and
Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988,
chairman Derrick HoldenBrown said in a speech prepared for
delivery to Toronto analysts.
    "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above
those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four
years up to 1985.
    "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position
and improved on it," HoldenBrown said.
    AlliedLyons won control of Hiram WalkerGooderham last
year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a
49 pct stake after an outofcourt settlement.
    Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported
liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983,
294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981.
    HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons financial results for the
fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months
of Hiram WalkerGooderham profits, but he did not provide
actual figures.
    He said Hiram WalkerGooderhams profit improvement in the
current year will come from a previously announced
reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close
partnership with AlliedLyons existing Allied Vintners
division.

<TITLE>MEXICO WARNS OF WORSENING THIRD WORLD DEBT WOES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>High interest rates, sluggish global
economic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening the
third world debt crisis, senior Mexican officials said.
    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said todays signing of
a 76 billion dlr newloan and rescheduling package for Mexico
was the most comprehensive and farreaching effort in debt
management yet achieved for a sovereign borrower.
    But, in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony, he
warned against complacency. "The debt problem is not solved. If
anything, it has been exacerbated by recent events."
    "The inequities of the international economic environment
conspire against the welfare and stability of developing
countries," Petricioli added. The debt problem will not be
solved unless developing countries are allowed to grow, he
argued. "There will be no solution without the further
development of trade throughout the world.".
    Director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters that
Mexicos economy should resume growth this year, but he said
external conditions are not favorable. Latin America is
grappling with adverse terms of trade, for instance, as
underlined by the recent slide in coffee prices.
    Interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms,
Gurria added. "Inflation has literally disappeared from the
face of the earth in the industrialized world, but interest
rates are still near seven pct."
    Industrial powers must also improve the coordination of
their economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth rates
and to keep export markets open, said Gurria, who is Mexicos
chief debt negotiator.
    The officials also had a blunt warning for those banks that
refuse to participate in the loan package Do not expect to get
much business with Mexico in the future.
    About 60 of Mexicos 430 or so creditor banks worldwide
have still to join the loan, but four more acceptances were
received today, according to senior Citibank executive William
Rhodes, who is cochairman of Mexicos advisory committee.
    "Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will
continue to be open and willing to share with them the business
opportunities which its future growth will create.
    "Those few who have denied their responsibility have turned
their backs on this remarkable effort of international
cooperation, on the financial system and on their enlightened
colleagues," Petricioli said.
    One way that Mexico could punish recalcitrant banks would
be to deny, or at least slow down, applications to convert
Mexican debt into equity investments within the country.
    "We will be a lot more expeditious in processing the
requests of banks that have supported us," Gurria said, adding,
"We have long memories."
    Debtequity conversions are an attractive way for banks to
provide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in Mexico
and to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their own
Mexican exposure in the process.    
    The growing popularity of the scheme was underlined this
week when American Express Bank, which has joined the new
Mexican package, said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of its
own loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in Mexico.
    Mexico halted the debtequity program on Feb. 25 to force
banks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage, and
Gurria said it would resume once the first part of the six
billion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed.
    The loan is now 99 pct subscribed. Gurria said Mexico hopes
to close the books by the middle of April in time for a
drawdown by the end of April.
    Although the agreements were signed in the sumptuous
surroundings of a midtown Manhattan hotel, the atmosphere of
the signing ceremony was rather subdued, with bankers and
officials showing little of the elation and relief that
normally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal.
    After five months of arduous work syndicating the loan,
debt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make the
financing process less cumbersome.
    "This package has been harder than all the others... I
hope we find a way thats not so debilitating for the people
who have to put them together," Gurria said.

<TITLE>AMERICAN CAN ltAC> SEES HIGHER YEAR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK , March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>American Can Co chairman Gerald Tsai
said the company will record higher earnings in the first
quarter and for the full year.
    Addressing analysts, Tsai said "First quarter results have
been extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 will
show significant improvement over 1986."
    American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,
adjusted for a twoforone stock split, in 1986.
    In the 1986 first quarter, the company reported net income
of 67.5 mln dlrs, including onetime gains from sale of assets,
or 2.30 dlrs per share, before the stock adjustment.
    In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record a
onetime gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in
its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
than the expected gain the company predicted in February
because additional shares of the unit were sold.
    In response to a question, Tsai said American Cans
investment in Jefferies and Co is "very small".
    "We treat it as just another passive investment," he said.
According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of
Jefferies and is its largest single shareholder.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, chairman and founder of the
brokerage firm bearing his name, resigned from the firm and
said he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking
securities laws.
    Responding to another question, Tsai said AIDSrelated
claims were a small portion of claims made with American Cans
insurance subsidiaries in 1986.

said the waterclarity problem delaying the removal of fuel
from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant appears to have been resolved.
    The company said the slower than expected removal of the
fuel, which has been primarily due to the waterclarity
problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.
    A spokesman said the company had previously expected this
to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how
far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to
complete the entire cleanup by the end of 1988, he added.
    GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified
its opinion of GPUs financial statements, adding the recovery
of TMI2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading
to the qualified opinion.
    GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover
the costs of decommissioning TMI2 in future rate proceedings.
    As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list
other uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged
TMI2  the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for

<TITLE>HUDSONS BAY WRITEOFF MAINLY DUE TO DOME STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Toronto, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltHudsons Bay Co> said a writeoff of
40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 was
mainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd ltDMP>.
     The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs,
or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating
loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous
year.
     Hudsons Bay holds about four mln shares of Domes 10 pct
series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.
    Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all
preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder
the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per
share.
    Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common
reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per
share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Hudsons Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail
operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but
that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in
interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.
     Hudsons Bay also said its Markborough properties
subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from
98.8 mln dlrs the year before.
    Profit from nonMarkborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs
in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.
    Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs,
up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were
reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total
debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion
dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1
to one.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>French bank Credit Lyonnais said it
signed a protocol of agreement with the Soviet Union to
establish a joint financial group to help set up and finance
joint ventures between the Soviet Union and western firms.
    It said in a statement it signed the agreement here with
the Soviet central bank Gosbank and foreign trade bank
Vneshtorgbank, following the announcement earlier today of a
similar, but wholly separate, agreement between the Soviet
Union and Banque de lUnion Europeenne.
    No joint ventures have yet been finalised under January
1987 Soviet laws enabling joint ventures although some
protocols of intent aiming at their establishment have already
been agreed between western firms and the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U.S. FISH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has agreed to drop barriers to
Americancaught herring and pollock, opening the way for
shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.
    Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive
bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.
    He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of
processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln
dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later
years.
    There was no immediate assessment of the value of current
U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas
to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all
the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.
    At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily
suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade GATT that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the
two fish.
    He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year
after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.

<TITLE>CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU  USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>There are heightened fears that "El
Nino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the
1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents
and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the
U.S. Agriculture Departments officer in Lima said in a field
report.
    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,
flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to
increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.
    However, it said official sources still believe that this
years El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.
    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and
waters in the pacific.
    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being
experienced has not had an overall negative impact on
agricultural production.
    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce
yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the
crop cycle.
    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where
excessive moisture exists, it said.
    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply
of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve
prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and
slow the decline in sugar production, it said.
    If El Nino picks up momentum, Perus fishing industry could
receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish
catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in
1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.
    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three
to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high
enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.
    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will
intensify and carry on through late March, April and May
causing problems as crops approach harvest.
    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino
 only time will tell," the report said.

<TITLE>ALLIEDLYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ltAlliedLyons PLC> will report
substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended
March 7, chairman Derrick HoldenBrown said in answer to
reporters queries.
    "You will certainly see substantial growth in AlliedLyons
in the second half," HoldenBrown said following a presentation
to Toronto securities analysts.
    HoldenBrown declined to say whether second half growth in
profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
the first half. AlliedLyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
    AlliedLyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
associated with Elders IXL Ltds failed takeover bid for the
company, HoldenBrown also said.
    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
gain of about 60 mln stg on AlliedLyons sale of its 24.9 pct
interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
hopefully you win them all in the end," HoldenBrown said.
    Asked if he thought AlliedLyons is vulnerable to other
takeover attempts, HoldenBrown replied "No, I dont."
    "We must never be complacent and we must always be very
watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.
    HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons share price to corporate
earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
in the food and beverage industry.
    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
think," HoldenBrown said.
    HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons move to acquire Hiram
WalkerGooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
takeover bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."
    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
that people almost inevitably would say the acquisition was
defensive, but it never was," HoldenBrown told reporters.
    Asked by securities analysts if AlliedLyons plans a share
issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
Walker, HoldenBrown responded "Plan might be too strong a
word. But I must say I do feel the need for AlliedLyons to be
better known in Canada."

compared with a revised 34.9 mln lbs on February 1 for a net

    The number on hand compared with trade guesses of 33.5 to
36 mln lbs and the year ago figure of 51.2 mln lbs.
    Traders said the figure was toward the upper end of
expectations and may provide slight downward pressure because
of recent sharp gains in futures.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS ltAXP> AND UNIT GET SUBPOENAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co said it was
subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with documents on transactions in securities of
American Express and its former unit, Firemans Fund.
    American Express said its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc was also served with a subpoena. Shearson acted as
comanager in the underwriting of units of Firemans common
stock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,
it said.
    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates to
transactions with Jefferies and Co and others.
    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply with
all requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. American
Express said neither company is aware of any unlawful conduct
with respect to the matters and a thorough investigation is
continuing.
    American Express said the subpoenas were received
yesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiry
prior to receiving the subpoenas.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, said
he agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities
violations.
    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of market manipulation and another scheme
with Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insider
trading.
    Jefferies firm was censured by the SEC and ordered to
retain an outside consultant to review its procedures.
    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did not
identify who was involved in the market manipulation scheme
aside from Jefferies. It said "a certain issuer," which held
controlling interest in a second public company, offered
several mln shares of the companys common stock to the public
in a secondary offering during 1986.
    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a scheme
with an unidentified person to drive up the price of the second
companys stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferies
firm trade in the stock.
    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the loss
from those trading activities after sending a fake invoice to
another unnamed person, the government charged.
    American Express first offered Firemans Fund Corps stock
to the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to
41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27
pct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.
    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrant
to buy Firemans fund. The warrants are exercisable from the
issue date through March, 1989.
    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directly
to Firemans Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrants
are exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.
    American Express said if all warrants were exercised it
would own about 13 pct of Firemans fund.
    American Express stock fell 11/2, to 771/4 on volume of
1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,
first on rumors, then an announcement of an understanding
American Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13
pct of Shearson.
    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Express
will sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.
    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believe
the subpoenas will affect Nippons deal with American Express,
but it could result in a delay of the public offering
anticipated for Shearson.

    "If theyre forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearson
a little longer...big deal. Theyre certainly not going to
throw Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset," he
said.
    American Express has not commented on speculation it would
offer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it was
continuing to review options for the brokerage.
    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearson
would be forthcoming shortly.
    "It puts a cloud over it for a while...The market is
anxious to see them consumate whatever they were going to
consumate," Lewis said.

<TITLE>BALLY ltBLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY SUSAN ZEIDLER, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Bally Manufacturing Corps proposed
public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is
seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,
analysts said.
    "In the longerterm horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on
its gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc.
    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of
another noncasino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,
which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.
    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currently
has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club
company, but in the long term well wait and see how the
offering goes."
    Once Ballys biggest revenue producer, the health club unit
had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2
mln dlrs, 28 pct of Ballys revenues. Analysts estimate the
unit could be sold for for 300500 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said Ballys decision to offer shares in the unit
could be the first step to selling it.
    "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the
health club units debt, increase its cash flow and operating
income, making it an attractive buy to a third party," Steven
Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said.
    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8
mln shares, of the units common stock at 1315 dlrs a share.
   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce
parent Bally Manufacturings debt which has swelled to 1.6
billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase
of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile
takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.
    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a
separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20year convertible
subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of
short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally
spokesperson said.
    Analysts said Ballys health club units profits have
remained strong, but are skeptical about the industrys long
range prospects.
    "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has
grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a
permanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of Bear
Stearns.
    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the
public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that
overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.
     In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry are
just not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said one
analyst.
     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding
clubs run by notforprofit organizations, according to the
Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be
an 8.0billiondlrayear industry.
     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the
nations largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one has
the money to offer to buy it."
    "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no
leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through
acquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle,
chief financial officer of Livingwell INc ltWELL>, the nations
second largest fitness chain operator whih
    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in
acquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisition
the size of Bally at this time."

<TITLE>CENTRUST SAVINGS ltDLP> TO RECAPITALIZE STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Centrust Savings Bank said it will
recapitalize its common stock at the close of business today,
converting each share of outstanding common into 0.5 share of
common and 0.5 share of series one participating stock.
    Centrust said its shareholders previously approved the
recapitalization at a meeting held on February 20, 1987.
    Centrust said the series one stock, a newly created series
of Centrusts capital stock, has enhanced voting rights versus
the common stock. Series one holders generally will vote to
elect 75 pct of the board of directors, while common
shareholders will elect 25 pct, Centrust said.
    CenTrust added that the common stock will have the right to
vote along with the series one as a single class for the
election of 75 pct of the board only if the number of
outstanding "high voting stock," including the series one,
falls below a certain percentage of outstanding shares of all
classes and series of voting stock.
    CenTrust said the common stock gets one vote per share, the
series one gets ten votes per share and there is separate class
voting on some matters.
    CenTrust said series one dividends will be lower than
common stock dividends until April 1, 1992. 
    Also the series one will have limited preferential dividend
and liquidation rights and will be convertible into common
stock.
    Both series one and the recapitalized common stock shares
are scheduled to begin trading on the American Stock Exchange
on March 23, 1987.

<TITLE>BANKS HAD EXCESS POSITIONS WITH VW  NEWSLETTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>A financial newsletter which reported
last November that car maker Volkswagen AG ltVOWG.F> lost large
sums in currency transactions alleged that unnamed banks had
circumvented banking regulations with help from VWs foreign
exchange department.
    VW had no immediate comment and there was nothing in the
report by the newsletter, the Platow Brief, to link its new
allegations with a suspected currency swindle at VW which is
now being investigated by a prosecutor.
    VW said this month that it had had to make provision for
possible losses up to 480 mln marks in the possible currency
fraud.
    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin said the office was aware that the newsletter had
made the new allegations and would follow this with interest.
    Platow Brief said around 16 mainly foreign banks based in
West Germany had "parked" excess open positions in currency
trading with VWs foreign exchange department.
    Under West German banking law, banks may not end a trading
day with open positions totalling more than 30 pct of their
capital. During the day banks buy and sell currencies, usually
aiming to match up all deals by the end and balance their
books.
    Some traders who take a view on how currencies will move
may prefer to leave certain positions open, a speculative
situation that the German regulations are designed to limit.
    According to Platow Brief, some traders apparently were
getting round the regulation by getting VW to buy or sell
currencies and hold them temporarily so that their books were
squared. Up to 100 mln dlrs was sometimes involved.
    Nonbank corporations are not covered by the restrictions,
imposed after a bank crash in 1974 to protect bank depositors.
    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by
a fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases by
removal of the managers, if their active involvement is proved.
    But the Federal Banking Supervisory Office said it first
had to be established how far, if at all, regulations were
breached.
    The suspected VW currency swindle meanwhile involved
operations to protect the company against fluctuations in the
value of the dollar, VW spoksmen have said.
    Some operations to hedge against changes in currency values
were not completed, meaning VW stood to lose money.
    A senior executive has been fired and several other people
suspended, while a prosecutor is looking into the matter.

<TITLE>ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Unions winter grain
crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of
world weather and crop conditions said.
    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the
EF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latest
report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,
from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.
    "Compared with last year, the outlook for the Soviet
winter grain crop is far more pessimistic," she said. "But
its still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot
will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the
troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."
    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat
growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
received on 2535 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.
    The bitter winter cold temperatures  which broke record
lows that had stood for four decades  also may have taken its
toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.
    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
ample snow cover, which should have wellinsulated the majority
of crop areas from severe frost damage.
    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from
Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,
Martell said.
    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.
    Last falls dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
moisturedepleted pastures, while the cold winter weather
necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.
    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl
accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
thought and have to be made up with imports.
    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last
resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only
just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the
1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.
    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the
USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.
    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union
bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only
24 pct of that total.
    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87
was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their
estimates of Soviet imports up to 2528 mln tonnes, she said.

<TITLE>MEXICOS RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Additional capital inflows of 1.5
billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexicos reserves to
about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel
Gurria told reporters.
    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved
investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has
forced creditstarved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows
totalled a billion dlrs in fourthquarter 1986.
    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the
sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of
funds available for badly needed investment.
    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is
drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have
enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or
five months, Gurria noted.
    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on
the commercial banks 1.2 billion dlr investmentsupport
contingency facility. That money will be available until April
1988 if Mexicos export receipts and the price of oil fall
below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the
first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said
today, "We expect well never have to use it."
    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on
the second contingency facility included in the bank financing
package  a 500 mln dlr growth cofinancing loan with the World
Bank.
    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed
yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the
development of exports of manufactured goods.
    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion
dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and
export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.
    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its
International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days
based on a successful review of end1986 economic results.
    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of
discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets
for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF
for the rest of 1987.
    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight
bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris
Club.
    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella
agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs
of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize
pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.
    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he
said all countries from the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export
credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>First Interstate Bancorp said it

Commission for up to 1.50 billion dlrs principal amount of its

<TITLE>ICN PHARMACEUTICALS ltICN> SEEKING ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COSTA MESA, Calif., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  has
about 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs in
available credit, which it intends to use to buy a
pharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.
    At the companys annual meeting, he said an acquisition
could take place in the next 24 months.
    "The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for
acquisition today," Panic said, adding, "We are investigating a
number of companies." One company being studied could possibly
be acquired on a friendly basis, he said.
    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to
repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.
    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said
the such a purchase is necessary because ICNs current
marketing capability would not be sufficient to support
distribution of the companys products, given ICNs
expectations for market growth worldwide.
    ICNs principal product is ribavirin, also known as
Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and
described as a broadbased antiviral.
    The company has said its possible applications include
treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,
childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.
    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in
recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical
trials as a possible treatment of some AIDSrelated diseases.
    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard
to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its
review of data submitted by the company.
    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a
House Subcommittee is continuing.
    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are
conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not
ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.
    Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosol
form as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,
called respiratory syncytial virus.

<TITLE>CANADA COMMITTEE SEEKS LOWER CREDIT CARD RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The allparty House of Commons Finance
Committee has unanimously called for a "substantial" cut in
credit card interest rates charged by banks and other financial
institutions.
    In a report, the committee recommended that if action is
not taken soon, the government should investigate whether there
is "anticompetitive behaviour" among the banks.
    Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin told the Commons
prior to the release of the report he favored a cut in the
rates and promised to act quickly on its recommendations.
    The committee said interest rates should be lowered to no
more than the 15.9 pct per annum level announced recently by
the Toronto Dominion Bank.
    Rates on other bank cards range from 18 to 21 pct and to 24
to 28 pct on gasoline and department store cards.
    At a news conference, committee members said they would
call for a legislated rate ceiling if the banks do not take
action quickly.
    "I would be unhappy if they didnt make an announcement
next week," said Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn, also a member
of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party.
    New Democratic Party member Michael Cassidy said, "I hope
the banks see the writing on the wall and take appropriate
action."
    The group did recommend legislation be enacted to ensure a
uniform method of calculating interest on unpaid balances and
that a grace period be allowed for new purchases.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy Finance Ministers from the Group
of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to
discuss the world debt crisis, trade imbalances and currency
stability today following last months Paris monetary accord,
sources close to the talks said.
    The officials met at the offices of the International
Monetary Fund IMF to discuss broad aspects of world monetary
policy in preparation for the IMFs interim committee meeting
in Washington in April.
    The talks were the first highlevel international review of
the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by
the U.S., West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada to
stabilise world currency markets at around present levels
following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid1985.
    Other countries represented at todays talks were Italy,
which refused to attend last months meeting on the grounds
that it was being excluded from the real discussions, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.
    Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday
within the framework of the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development OECD to review the slow progress
being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr U.S. Trade
deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their
economies to more foreign imports.

<TITLE>EC AGREES TO REDUCE DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community EC agreed on
new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses
in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast
stretches of the regions forests.
    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed
member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few
years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main
source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.
    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with
tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and
for all new vehicles from October 1990.
    The ECs executive Commission says the emission level of
nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year
from three mln tonnes within the 12nation Community if all
heavy vehicles met the new standards.
    There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use in
the EC, according to Commission figures.
    The ministers also gave West Germany a goahead to move
towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn
requested permission to do so to encourage the use of
lowpollution cars, diplomats said.

<TITLE>EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community EC agreed
tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and
buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast
stretches of the regions forests.
    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed
member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few
years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main
source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.
    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with
tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and
for all new vehicles from October 1990.
    The ECs executive Commission says the emission level of
nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year
from three mln tonnes within the 12nation Community if all
heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.
    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in
the EC, according to Commission figures.
    The ministers also gave West Germany a goahead to move
towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn
requested permission to do so to encourage the use of
lowpollution cars, diplomats said.
    West Germany will still need ministers final approval for
such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC
environment ministers meet next on May 21.
    But the ministers added that the goahead for West Germany
did not mean there would automatically follow a Communitywide
ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.
    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats
said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20
mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no
damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.
    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special
permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition
laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement
a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.

<TITLE>AUDIO/VIDEO ltAVA>SWEETENS BID FOR CYCLOPS ltCYL></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>An investment group led by
Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to
acquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a
share.
    The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended
the offer until April three, from March 20.
    The group said it added several conditions to its offer,
including receipt of all nonpublic information about Cyclops
that was provided to ltDixons Group PLC> in connection with
Dixons competing tender offer for Cyclops.
    Cyacqs sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops
Dixons offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs.
    On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops
4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company
to 56 pct.
    Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange
Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until
March 24.
    Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders "will withdraw
previously tendered shares from Dixons tender offer to take
advantage of Cyacqs higher offer."
    The SECs order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons
from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of
Dixons tender offer.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq.
    Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops
rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the
U.K.based firm would receive "breakup fees" or expenses from
Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the
Pittsburghbased company.

<TITLE>LATIN NATIONS CALL FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN JOSE, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Representatives from 26 Latin American
countries ended a United Nations trade meeting here today with
a call for greater economic integration between developing and
industrialised countries.
    "We urge the international community to recognise the ...
difficulties which confront the region," a statement released by
the group, termed the San Jose Communique, said.
    The meeting was held under the auspices of the Latin
American Economic System, CEPAL, a United Nations affiliate,
and aimed to develop a joint regional position ahead of Julys
conference in Geneva of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, UNCTAD.
    The communique said Latin Americas priority remained the
need for sustained economic growth and for easier terms on its
400 billion dlrs external debt.
    Within that framework the region would be pressing in
Geneva for more access to industrialised markets for its
exports and for compensatory capital inflows when world prices
for its mainly agricultural exports were low, it said.
    The communique also said the group would press for the
generalised system of preferences  easy entry terms for
developing country exports  to be expanded.
    UNCTAD was set up in 1964 to promote better international
trading conditions for developing countries and help raise
their standard of living.

<TITLE>MOODYS CUTS BAKER ltBKO>, UPGRADES HUGHES ltHT></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Moodys Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded the debt ratings of Baker International Corp and
upgraded Hughes Tool Cos debt.
    The actions affect a combined 662 mln dlrs of securities.
    Moodys said the anticipated merger of Baker and Hughes
Tool into Baker Hughes Inc would result in increased financial
leverage at a time of weak demand for the combined companys
products and services.
    The agency cut the senior debt of Baker and its finance
unit, Baker International Finance N.V., to Baa1 from A2. It
affirmed Bakers Prime2 commercial paper.
    Moodys upgraded Hughes Tools senior debt to Baa1 from
B2 and subordinated debt to Baa2 from B3.
    The rating agency said that a poor outlook for the oil
services industry would pressure earnings and cash flow for
Basker Hughes over the intermediate term.
    However, Moodys noted that the combined company would
benefit from cost reductions and consolidations made possible
by the merger. Also, the companys competitive position should
be substantially strengthened by the merger, Moodys said.

<TITLE>NIAGARA MOHAWK ltNMK> TO CUT COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYRACUSE, N.Y., March 20  </DATELINE><BODY>Niagara Mohawk Corp said it is
"cautiously optimistic" about results improvements for 1987 and
said it is studying measures to cut operating costs.
    These measures include freezing management salaries,
abolishing vacant positions and reducing overtime.
    A spokesman said the company had no current plans to lay
off workers. The company declined to say how much the cost
savings would amount to.
    A five year forecast is expected to be issued in early
summer, a spokesperson said.
    The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high
cost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year.
    For 1986, Niagara Mohawks earnings per share fell to 2.71
dlrs from 2.88 dlrs in 1985..
    The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of
a reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed
by the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission.
    Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering
of authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a 
fair return on equity.
