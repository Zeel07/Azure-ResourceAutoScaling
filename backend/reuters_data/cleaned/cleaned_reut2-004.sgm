<TITLE>INCO SEES NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM DOW REMOVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Inco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the companys stock.
    "We dont think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 13/8 lower at 193/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the nonCommunist worlds largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Replacing Inco and OwensIllinois Inc will be CocaCola Co
and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow.
    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran
Murray Ltd said Incos removal from the index would likely
spark shortterm selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, well,
because its not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment," said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious longterm impact on Inco stock.
    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower
nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in
1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>DOCTORS FIND LINK BETWEEN AIDS, SMALLPOX VIRUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>In a discovery that could complicate the
search for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors said
they have uncovered a potentiallyfatal interaction between the
AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox.
     Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
said a 19yearold man, who apparently had been exposed to the
AIDS virus, developed a poxlike disease and died after
receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits
for AIDS before vaccinating them.
    The findings, reported in The New England Journal of
Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working
on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.
     "Our case report raises provocative questions concerning
the ultimate safety of such vaccines," said the group led by
Dr. Robert Redfield.
     The report also throws into question the belief held by
some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people
to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox,
could be further modified to protect people against a host of
other diseases.

<TITLE>BIRTH CONTROL PILLS HELP PREVENT CANCER  STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Doctors at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birth
control pills can help provide longterm protection from cancer
of the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a few
months.
     The study, reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine, also found that all the various types of oral
contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering
the rate of ovarian cancer.
     The researchers estimated that the use of birth control
pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of
ovarian cancer in 1982.
    As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives
"move into the age groups that are at highest risk for
epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence
of this serious disease," they said.
     Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that
"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the
risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to
54 years of age.
     "The effect probably takes from five to ten years to
become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral
contraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless of
the formulation of oral contraceptive used," they said.

<TITLE>U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. economic data this week could be
the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
out of a 31/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
positive for the market, the analysts said.
    "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
right now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
Sloane.
    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
quickly covered short positions, they said.
    "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
as expected it wont be that bad for the market," Sloane said.
    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the nonauto sector
of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
she put the range for the nonauto sector of retail sales at up
0.8 to 1.2 pct.
    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
added.
    Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be able
to fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
bonds between 10026/32 and 1013/32 created Friday. June bonds
closed at 1004/32 today.
    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
    "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
market approached the top of the range," Singer said.
    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oil
rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"
Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
six pct level."
    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
ease to 996/32 and find support.
    "Im not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.

<TITLE>U.S. "ACTION PROGRAM" FOR SUBSAHARAN AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration,
responding to last years United Nations special session on
Africa, today outlined a U.S. "action program" for subSaharan
Africa focusing heavily on economic reform and selfhelp.
    A White House statement announced establishment of "a
longterm U.S. goal for all U.S. economic programs and policies
in subSaharan Africa to end hunger in the region through
economic growth, policy reform and private sector development."
    The statement said the "program of action" was recommended by
a White House task force set up last September.
    In a series of recommendations, the task force called for
new efforts to address Africas heavy debt burden and said U.S.
food aid should stress production incentives to reinforce
African nations economic reform and productivity.
    It also said better African access to world markets should
be promoted to reward good performance and enable African
nations to earn their way toward economic growth.
    The U.S. private sector should be mobilized to provide
"private, voluntary and corporate involvement of a humanitarian
    It said donor countries "should negotiate, through the
existing International Monetary Fund/World Bank coordination
process, framework agreements with each subSaharan African
country to establish longterm structural adjustment and reform
programs."
    The task force called for a separate budget account for
U.S. bilateral aid "in order to focus better on rewarding
economic performance and increasing the flexibility of U.S.
assistance programs for incentive economic reforms and private
sector development."

<TITLE>UNUSUAL TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ltTXN> PREFERRED PRICED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>In a novel type of financing, Texas
Instruments Inc marketed a threepart, 225 mln dlr issue of
convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager.
    Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept,
said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the
first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike
price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the
common stock price when terms were set.
    Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220
dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend
preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium.
    Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 21/8.
    Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that
"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the
first tranche."
    He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction
money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion
feature of this issue is the new wrinkle.
    Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the
original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20
pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense
demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs.
    The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the
first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the
latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed.
    Like nonconvertible money market preferred stock, the new
version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven
weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them,
or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction
dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance.
    Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of
investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money
managers and pension funds.

<TITLE>CLARK SAYS HE EXPECTS U.S. ACTION ON ACID RAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Foreign Secretary Joe
Clark, winding up a twoday visit to Washington, said he
expected the Reagan administration to take some action on
reducing acid rain.
    "My impression is there will be some movement by the United
States administration on acid rain but how much movement I
cant judge or predict," he told reporters.
    The meetings with American officials are part of a routine
U.S.Canada consultation but are also expected to lay the
groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between President
Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary James
Baker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and
George Mitchell of Maine.
    Yesterday, he held talks with Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige.
    Among its priorities, Canada is seeking evidence that
Reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to
implement in the United States a fiveyear 5 billion U.S. dlr
program to test cleaner ways of burning coal.
    This issue was discussed at length with Baker and several
of the senators, including Mitchell who urged Canada to "keep
the heat on" the Reagan administration to force action, Canadian
officials said.
    Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker were
trade issues, including the need for the United States and
Canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade
disputes between the two countries, who are each others major
trading partner, Canadian officials said.

<TITLE>FASTER TEST FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA DEVELOPED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   BOSTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>A team of California researchers said
that they have developed a better, faster test for detecting
sickle cell anemia in unborn children than existing procedures.
     The test, developed by Cetus Corp ltCTUS> researchers,
requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetus
and produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests that
require several days and can only be done in a few specialized
centers, they said.
     Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood disease
that causes the normallyflexible red blood cells to stiffen
into a sicklelike shape. It is primarily found in blacks.
    The researchers said in The New England Journal of Medicine
that their "procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive and
reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell
disease."
     In addition, they said, the technique might also be
adapted to detect other types of genetic disease.

<TITLE>USX ltX> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at yearend 1985.
    The figures, in USXs justreleased 1986 annual report,
indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
    USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
and gas operations.
    About 24 pct of total sales came from USXs USS steel unit
and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
    According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
    Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
at yearend 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
    Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
    U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
from 1.53 trillion.
    In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
figure the company reported on Jan 27.
    USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
    In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
included the "indefinite idling" last month of four plants in
Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
    Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
    "These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
market conditions for the products from these plants may make
it feasible to reopen some of them," USX said in the report.
    "On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
may necessitate their permanent closing," it added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPSltP> SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman C. J.
"Pete" Silas said his companys stock, ranked fourth on the
most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of
steps it took to pare its debt.
    Silas told Reuters in an interview today, "part of this
strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because
some of the analysts have been happy with the steps weve taken
in 1986 to pare our debt."
    Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following
recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said.
    Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986
down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said.
    "At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual
price of oil," he added.
    Silas said, "if the analysts are right that oil prices will
rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy
Phillips." He is, however, more cautious about the strength in
crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 1618
dlrs a barrel for the year.
    Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stocks
popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount
to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small
investors.
    Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S.
Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of
the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs.
    "The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The
company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act
together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good
room for improvement," he said.
   But, he added, "if oil prices turn lower, there will be a
lot of pressure on Phillips."
   Phillips shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the
last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 113/4 dlrs in 1987.   
Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be
revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves.
   Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to
about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none
were planned.

<TITLE>BANK OF B.C. REVISES SHARE PAYOUT ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of British
Columbia said it revised its estimate of shareholder
distributions from last Novembers sale of most of the banks
assets to HongKong Bank of Canada to between 65 cts and 1.15
dlrs a share from 55 cts to 1.20 dlrs a share.
    The bank said the estimate could rise to between 1.30 dlrs
and 1.80 dlrs a share if the full pension surplus is obtained.
It said it did not know when distributions would be made.
    It earlier reported that operating profit for first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 273,000 dlrs from 1.7 mln dlrs the
previous year.
    For fullyear 1986 ended October 31, the bank posted an
operating loss of 4.4 mln dlrs against yearearlier profit of
7.5 mln dlrs. The bank also posted a 66 mln dlr extraordinary
loss in fiscal 1986.
    Bank of British Columbia sold most of its assets last
November to HongKong Bank Canada, a unit of ltHongKong and
Shanghai Banking Corp>, of Hong Kong, for 63.5 mln dlrs.
    It said efforts to wind up the banks affairs were
proceeding as quickly as possible.
    The bank said it expected to report positive earnings in
future periods, barring unforeseen circumstances.
    Loan losses, which the bank previously said figured in its
move to sell off most of its assets, rose to 105.7 mln dlrs in
fiscal 1986 from yearearlier 36.1 mln dlrs. The bank said 31.1
mln dlrs of the 1986 total represented downward adjustments to
its portfolio of syndicated sovereign risk loans as required
under the sale to HongKong Bank.
    Since November 27, the bank has confined activities to the
winding up of affairs, Bank of British Columbia said.

<TITLE>HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK CONTRA AID FOR SIX MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The House voted to block 40 mln dlrs
in military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan
accounts for past assistance, including money diverted from the
U.S. sale of arms to Iran.
    The vote was seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has
made aid to the "contras" a key initiative.
    Congressional Democratic leaders have conceded that despite
todays vote, they can not muster a twothirds majority to

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>House trade lawmakers took their
first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
controversial plans to protect American industries.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
in the billwhether they will force major foreign trading
partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
States.
    The subcommittee is considering a toneddown version of
Democraticsponsored trade legislation that aims to open
foreign markets but which drops last years effort to force
President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
specific trade penalties.
    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
his partys 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
getting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.
    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
congressional and administration effort to turn around the
record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
competitive.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
    "I expect whatever is reported by the Ways and Means
Committee will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
bill," he told reporters.
    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
to improve education and worker training.
    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
countrys economic development.
    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
    The administration has not announced its support but
Yeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that the
Democraticled House will come up with an acceptable bill.

<TITLE>SOVIET MINISTER SAYS TRADE BOOST UP TO FRENCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet first deputy prime minister
Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
reduction of Frances trade deficit with the Soviet Union
depended on the French.
    Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
AgroIndustrial Committee GOSAGROPROM, told a news conference
he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
companies RhonePoulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
    Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
sulphuric gas with RhonePoulenc, packaging technology for
agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
juice processing with Imec.
    An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
details. The other two companies were not immediately available
for comment.
    Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of Frances
trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
told Reuters "It all depends on France."
    At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
    Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
anybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technology
and assuring "a mutual advantage."
    He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
    He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
guaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in joint
ventures.
    But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
new joint venture laws.
    He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
month with French businessman JeanBaptiste Doumeng.
    He said Doumengs Interagra company was preparing proposals
for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
goods.
    Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Unions
food production capacity.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO LEND OIL TO ECUADOR FOR EXPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 11  </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela will supply ecuador with an
as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export
commitments, seriously affected by last weeks earthquake,
energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.
    He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil
loan agreement will be made between state oil companies
petroleos de venezuela pdvsa and ecuadors cepe.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected
four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil
accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.
     Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace
on the results of talks with ecuadors deputy energy minister

    "the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its
opec quota and would not affect venezuelas," he said. "we would
from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional
amounts that ecuador would be repaying us," he said.
    He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say
ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be

    Venezuelas opec output quota is currently 1.495 million

<TITLE>BRITAIN CALLS ON JAPAN TO INCREASE IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Britain today called on Japan to
increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and
the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.
    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said
Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government
advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to
help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.
    "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to
Japans domestic economy," he told a group of Japanese
businessmen in London.
    "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to
deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.
    "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import
propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from
protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan
has so massive a surplus," he said.
    "They may well succeed in securing action by governments
which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan
and the U.K."
    Channon said there had been substantial growth in the
volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2
billion sterling 9.8 billion dlrs last year.
    But he added "Regrettably too much of it was in one
direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling
5.8 billion dlrs more than we sold them."

    Taft said the board concluded that the offer failed to

<TITLE>ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to
postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,
Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.
    He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks is
to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean
economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments
on the foreign debt during the present year."
    The statement referred only to payments due to private
foreign banks, a senior government finance official told
Reuters.
    These creditors hold twothirds of Ecuadors foreign debt
which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.
    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments
and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder
of Ecuadors foreign debt, the official said.
    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450
and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and
about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.
    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from
multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here
soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.
    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency
aid from about 40 foreign governments.
    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987
budget from last Thursdays earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Ecuadors total service on the foreign debt was
about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.
    The quake ruptured Ecuadors main oil pipeline, suspending
crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil
accounts for up to twothirds of its total exports and up to 60
pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended
interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.
    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a
cashflow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,
which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.
    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact
every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its
14bank advisory committee, the senior government finance
official said. The committee represents the countrys 400 or so
private foreign bank creditors.
    Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks should
perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with
what was forseen."
    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line
with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options
of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."
    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private
foreign banks.
    Ecuadors initial proposal earlier this year was to make
only one semiannual or one annual interest payment this year.
    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments
until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government
officials here said.
    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with
the advisory committee in New York in January, but the
negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12hour
kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force
paratroopers.
    The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least
4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last weeks earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuadors export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuadors South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<TITLE>CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>China has closed the second round of
bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,
the China Daily has reported.
    It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil
Corp CNOOC as saying China signed eight contracts with 15
foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
    Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
well has so far produced results  Lufeng 1311, 250 km
southeast of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
    The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
terminated after no oil was discovered.
    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore
China since 1979.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp ltAMO> management
has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corps ltC> 1.5
billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.
    Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.
    American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to
review the takeover proposal. "The board ... Expects to be
meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the
Chrysler proposal," AMC said in its first formal statement since
it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.
    Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the
merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMCs
profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern
car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.
    That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it
leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000plus
employees, according to industry analysts. AMCs Toledo, Ohio
Jeep plant has 1,850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while
its Kenosha, Wisconsin, car plant has another 2,250 on layoff.

<TITLE>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The net inflow of foreign investment
into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion
a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.
    The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08
billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion
turnaround in direct investment.
    The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion
inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a
520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of
government foreign currency borrowings, it said.
    Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion
dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in
the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth
quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.
    It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an
injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs,
associated with the previously reported restructuring of the
Australian operations of General Motors Corp ltGM>.
    GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain
Australian liabilities of its local unit ltGeneral
MotorsHoldens Ltd>, it said.
    However, net borrowings remained the major part of total
inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a
year earlier, the Bureau said.
    Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against
a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln
inflow a year earlier.
    Total private and semipublic authority net borrowings rose
to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and
3.51 billion a year earlier.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union carried out a nuclear
test early today, the official Tass news agency reported.
    According to the report, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation, the explosion was at 0200 gmt.
    A blast on February 26 ended a 19month unilateral test
moratorium declared by the Soviet Union. Moscow blamed the end
of the freeze on U.S. Refusal to join a total test ban.
    Tass said the latest explosion, with a power of up to 20
kilotonnes, had "the aim of improving military equipment."

<TITLE>TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES FOREIGN GOODS IMPORT CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan said it would soon relax import
controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and
books, in a further effort to allow trading partners,
especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.
    Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600
farm and industrial products last month, a Council for Economic
Planning and Development spokesman told Reuters.
    He said the new move was intended to balance trade between
Taiwan and its trading partners. The islands trade surplus
reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from
10.62 billion in 1985.
    In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign
products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes.
    "We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus
this year, especially with that of the U.S.," the spokesman
said.
    Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as
a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose
to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from
1.87 billion in the yearearlier period.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>International efforts to redirect Japans
exportdriven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy
going if the countrys largest defence contractor and worlds
biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.
    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ltMITH.T> MHI, which began
making ships and iron goods for Japans military rulers 130
years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its
efforts to maintain its share of export markets.
    "If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,
everyone will buy them," MHI president Yotaro Iida said.
    Although two of MHIs main businesses, shipbuilding and
power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yens 40
pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to
abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.
    Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has
performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money
Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.
    "We have made the utmost efforts among the worlds
manufacturers to improve productivity," he said. "You may be
surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but
the inside is ultramodern, with robots and computers."
    Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that
MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The
company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in
1976.
    Despite its costcutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40
pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March
31, from 1985/86s record 50.14 billion.
    And that includes gains from the sale of MHIs stake in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp ltMIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.
    Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a
resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent
recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power
plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its
exportstosales ratio to the past decades average of 30 pct.
    MHIs exportstosales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the
halfyear ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years
ago.
    China is the most promising market, although MHI also
considers other nonoilproducing developing countries as major
customers.
    "Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a
lack of foreign currency," Iida said. But he added that he felt
MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government
financial support.
    It can also finance the plants itself and recover its
investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could
prove popular in the future.
    In shipping, MHI is fighting back against lowpriced South
Korean competition by building more technologically advanced
carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products
difficult to transport.
    Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the
worlds largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.
    Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,
including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch
vehicles for manmade satellites.
    It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence
Agencys F15 and F14 jet fighters and missiles, although all
of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.
    MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to
develop the countrys own fighter plane to replace the
currently used F1 support fighters in the late 1990s.
    Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure
on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp
F18 or General Dynamics Corp F16, to reduce Japans huge
trade surplus with the U.S.
    "It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.
Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella," Iida
said.
    MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic
Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in
the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.
    The U.S. Has been seeking Japans technological support.
    In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHIs
sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said
the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special
vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.
    As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift
the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to
manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to
specify which products.
    "By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on
your daily products, although this does not mean we will run
away from our mainstream business," he said.

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKRUPTCIES DECLINE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Japans corporate bankruptcies in
February fell 10.8 pct from January to 1,071 cases and total
debts dropped 49.4 pct to 149.40 billion yen, the Tokyo
Commerce and Industry Research Co said.
    February bankruptcies fell 14.9 pct from a year earlier,
the 26th straight monthly decline, and debts fell 54.3 pct.
    The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a
relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill
settlements due to fewer operating days, it said.
    Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the
dollar totalled 69, or 6.4 pct of those in February, with debts
of 25.52 billion yen, the research firm said.
    This compared with 64 with debts of 125.59 billion yen in
January, it said.
    Currencylinked bankruptcies since November 1985, when the
dollars depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese
exportlinked firms, totalled 772, with cumulative debts of
660.53 billion yen, it said.
    The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average
153.49 yen per dollar in February from 184.62 a year earlier.
    Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the
year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons.
    Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter
starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending,
low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in
April, and slow capital spending by manufacturers, the company
said.
    Bankrupcties among exportlinked subcontractors will rise
due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas
production, it added.

<TITLE>LEIGHPEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin LeighPemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries annual
dinner.
    LeighPemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders  who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," LeighPemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
of a takeover has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    LeighPemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
companys management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the shortterm, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highlycharged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility  even if
it entails opprobrium  for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

<TITLE>JAPANESE PURCHASE OF U.S. HIGHTECH FIRM OPPOSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor
maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.
    The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns
on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd
ltSLB> unit ltFairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd
ltITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the United
States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used
in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
gathering.
    The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the
strained relations between the two countries stemming from the
huge Japanese trade surplus.
    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
sale in the coming weeks, they said.
    Defence Secretary Caspar Weinbergers position was not
known, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high
technology to foreign governments or companies.
    Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in the
world, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it prefers
local manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers.

tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986,
trade ministry officials said.
    More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes,
will come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pct
increase on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, an

    He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to the
competitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by
Seoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington. South Korea
is the second largest importer of U.S. Cotton after Japan.

<TITLE>AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Wheat Boards AWB
1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes
already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
target for the year," he said in a statement.
    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB
spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the
Soviet Union and Iraq.
    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB
exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.
    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has
ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered
to the AWB.
    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of
receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.
    However, it is likely that some weatherdamaged grain was
still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWBs February
Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.
    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the
final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.
The official estimate is not yet available.
    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of
the 16.13 mln tonne crop.
    Another 422,000 tonnes was retained onfarm and 620,000
sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow
farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWBs
receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics
data.

<TITLE>CONVERTIBLE YEN BOND BROKERAGE FEE MAY BE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a
statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen
convertible bonds.
    The cut would be in response to a planned increase in
securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10,000 yen from 4.5 as
part of the governments proposed tax reform bills, securities
house managers said.
    Under the current system, investors must also pay 0.6 pct
of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for
transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen.
    The exchanges draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage
rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted,
market sources said.
    Details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet
to be worked out, an exchange spokesman said.
    The news had little immediate impact on the convertible
bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates
will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary
approval of the tax reform bills is uncertain due to opposition
to them, securities dealers said.

<TITLE>JAPANS OVERSEAS OUTPUT FORECAST TO RISE 26 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The overseas production in yen terms of
Japanese firms should rise 26 pct in 1987/88 ending March after
a four pct fall in 1986/87, a Ministry of International Trade
and Industry survey said.
    It attributed the rise to companies moving production
overseas to avoid losses due to the strong yen. The survey
covered 122 major firms in 17 sectors.
    The survey called for bold moves to stimulate domestic
demand to achieve the governments goal of 3.5 pct gross
national product growth in 1987/88. A package of economic
measures to boost the economy is expected next month.
    The survey said Japanese car output in the United States
and Canada would jump to two mln vehicles in fiscal 1990 from
617,000 in 1986 and worldwide electronic appliance output would
rise 31.7 pct. Domestic unemployment is likely to reach four
pct, or about 2.5 mln jobless, in fiscal 1990 from three pct
now if current trends continue.
    Recruitment in the car industry is expected to fall by 35
pct in 1987/88 and by 40 pct in the electronics sector.
    The steel industry plans to cut its 150,000 workforce by 27
pct by the end of 1990/91 and the shipbuilding, coal and
nonferrous metal industries all plan big cuts in 1987/88.

<TITLE>STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SANTOS, Brazil, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Striking seamen said they would
offer their collective resignation rather than end their
13dayold national strike on managements terms.
    The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after
marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday
night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work
under duress.
    President Jose Sarneys government despatched troops to
Brazils ports and oil installations on Tuesday.
    Seamen in Santos, Brazils main port, are in defiant mood.
One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that
most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations
on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the
countrys main ports.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious
debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade
balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get,
and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm
the strike is doing to exports.
    An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners
Association read, "The seamens strike is illegal, irrational
and unpatriotic."
    The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present
salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the
unions office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977
cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their
total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.
    At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados
a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with
allowances. 
    "Brazils seamen are the second worst paid in the world,
after Ghanas," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not
received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have
doubled since then with the collapse of the governments
Cruzado Plan price freeze.
    Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister
Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the
dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct
but have been offered less than half that.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN COFFEE PRODUCTION MAY FALL THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesias coffee production in
1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last years
level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.
    He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may
have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how
seriously. Indonesias main crop is harvested next month.
    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it
would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks
were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.
    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise
much from last years level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exports
will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"
he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,
but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low
prices, he added.
    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target
of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying
to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,
better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

<TITLE>RENOUF SELLS 10.83 PCT NZI STAKE TO BRIERLEY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>ltRenouf Corp Ltd> said it sold its
10.83 pct stake in ltNZI Corp Ltd> to ltBrierley Investments
Ltd>, BIL, for 207.7 mln N.Z. Dlrs.
    Renouf managing director Mike Cashin said in a statement it
had been Renoufs intention to build up a longterm strategic
position in NZI. "But it became clear to us that it was in the
best interests of both NZI and ourselves for Brierley
Investments to acquire our holding," he said.
    He said Renouf built up its NZI holding over the past six
months. The sale comprised 74.9 mln shares at 2.725 N.Z. Dlrs a
share and 2,095 warrants at 1,709 dlrs each.
    The warrants are attached to a 150 mln Swiss franc note
issue. Each bond of 5,000 francs carries a detachable warrant
entitling the bearer to 2,486 NZI shares.
    In its 1986 annual report BIL reported that it held a 19
pct stake in NZI.
    NZI has 673.4 mln ordinary shares on issue. Total capital
including shares attached to warrants is 678.8 mln shares.
    Cashin said the sale will result in a significant profit
and places Renouf in a good position to consolidate on recent
transactions and pursue other opportunities.
    NZI shares were at 2.18 N.Z. Dlrs, BIL at 4.08 and Renouf
at 6.15 at the close of trading.
    BIL executives were unavailable for comment.

<TITLE>SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabias 11 commercial banks are
reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non
performing loans.
    Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
little this year.
    But the kingdoms still sluggish economy and legal problems
hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
remain vulnerable.
    One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely
done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,
but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."
    The sudden decline of Saudi Arabias corporate sector in
1983  culminating in a number of debt reschedulings  has
taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now
appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
decline.
    The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdoms banks had
sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world
oil prices tumbled.
    Of the kingdoms nine jointventure banks which operate on
the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and
revealed a further profits decline  or net loss  for 1986 at
the expense of increased provisions.
    The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, ltUnited Saudi
Commercial Bank> USCB reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln
riyals, marginally less than 1985s shortfall of 17.0 mln.
    Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part
reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly
trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.
    Other results released so far show ltSaudi American Bank>
SAMBA reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7
mln riyals, while ltAl Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi
French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.
    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorps ltCCI.N>
Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,
increased provisions sharply.
    ltArab National Bank>s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1
mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln
riyals.
    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non
performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
Saudi economy bottoms out.
    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
activity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
are now at or close to international levels on provisions."
    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdoms largest bank ltNational
Commercial Bank> NCB stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in
provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the
private sector, bankers calculated.
    Between 1982 and 1985, ltRiyad Bank>, NCBs rival as the
second biggest of the two allSaudi shareholding banks, had
covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate
on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.
    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency SAMA has been
tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for
declaring loans as nonperforming.
    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
difficult because some banks still book nonaccruing interest
as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
force in major world financial centres.
    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the
jointventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
as the strongest earners.
    Other banks such as ltSaudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by
the ltBritish Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a
relatively low deposit base.
    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln
riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
conservative in making provisions.
    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
Saudi bank go under and not only supported ltSaudi Cairo Bank>
after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
available cheap deposits to ltSaudi Investment Bank> and USCB.
    The banks can onlend these to generate profit, but
generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
unwilling to risk incurring fresh nonperforming loans.
    And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
attempt to diversify away from traditional lending,
conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
fee income from new investment banking products.
    One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
good."
    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of
advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when
banks had ample funds in interestfree current accounts to
invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
on their money.
    In 1979, the ratio of interestbearing accounts to current
accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer
funds are held on current account.

Lawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover of
Scotch whisky maker ltThe Distillers Co Plc>.
    But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of the
Guinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island of

    Britains Department of Trade and Industry is investigating
the takeover.
    Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward
"breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment to
Ward, via a Jerseybased company, Marketing and Acquisitions
Consultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.
    MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the main

Argyll ltAYLL.L> Group Plc.
    "The bid would not have been successful but for the ...
Services of Mr Ward," MAC attorneys said in the documents
submitted in court. "The payment was, in all the circumstances,
reasonable, proper and fully earned."

<TITLE>INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian coffee exporters are
preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their
government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of
export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian
Coffee Exporters AICE told Reuters.
    Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,
the worlds third largest producer, is trimming costs and
improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.
    "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we
can never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.
    Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,
along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a
new quota system at last months failed International Coffee
Organistion ICO talks in London.
    Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the
Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.
    AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts
with Brazil to suggest a compromise.
    Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO
negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight
were in contact with Colombia, the worlds second largest
producer, but gave no details.
    "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a
compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market
stays like it is," Muda said.
    He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the
U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of
an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.
    Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.
And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press
them to present Indonesias case more firmly.
    He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the
countrys coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.
    Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with
the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing
quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."
    The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which
gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not
reflect uptodate supply and demand trends.
    Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old
system be applied.
    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market
prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.
    Although prices have long since come down to a point where
export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers
at the 75member ICO have not been able to agree on new
guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both
refusing to alter their positions.
    Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed
Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.
    Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the
AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.
    Indonesias coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,
is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last years level
of 360,000 tonnes, he said.
    He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for
the time of year.

<TITLE>JAPANESE CORPORATE EARNINGS RECOVERY PREDICTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9
pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first yearonyear increase in
three years, partly because of the yens stable exchange rate,
the Nomura research institute said.
    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in
the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura
Securities Co said in a statement.
    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the
current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.
    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the
dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.
    Corporate efforts to cope with the yens appreciation, such
as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next
fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also
benefit from pumppriming expected from the government and a
halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.
    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected
to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct
fall in the current year.
    Nonmanufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in
1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year,
it said.

<TITLE>BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     STOCKHOLM, Mar 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish mining and metals group
Boliden AB ltBLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during
1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by
a massive writeoff.
    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and
investment conglomerate ltAhlsell AB> this year, said the result
included restructuring costs and writeoffs of 802 mln crowns.
    "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of
direction for the group. They are mainly oneoff but they have
burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.
    Boliden said the companys liquid assets were 1.36 billion
crowns at yearend which together with an investment portfolio
of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish
companies.
    As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed
cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return
to profitability during 1987, the statement added.
    Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm
ltTrelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the
beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans
for consolidating Boliden.

<TITLE>FRENCH 1986 CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS REVISED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The French 1986 current account balance
of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8
billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced
last month, the Finance Ministry said.
    This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while
it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than
the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist
government before they lost office in March last year.
    Net longterm capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion
francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a
major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.
    In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to
14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but
the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.
    Fourth quarter medium and longterm foreign debt repayments
exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.

<TITLE>ROWNTREE REPORTS PRETAX PROFIT AT 84 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Rowntree Mackintosh Plc ltRWNT.L>
announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
previous year.
    Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
    The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
yesterdays close, but slightly off preannouncement opening
levels.
    Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
up from the previous years 60.7 mln.
    The U.K. Remained Rowntrees largest centre for trading
profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
    Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
    Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
represented additional provisions for the cost of
rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
    Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
    Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
including further moves in the speciality retailing business
which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
    Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
    The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
increased trading margins. The SunPat British grocery concern
increased profit and Rowntrees small health food business,
Holgates, raised earnings 10fold, the statement said.
    Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealands budget deficit in the
10 months to January widened to 4.37 billion N.Z. Dlrs from
3.41 billion in the 10 months to January 1986, government
figures show.
    Revenue rose to 12.92 billion dlrs from 10.82 billion,
while spending climbed to 17.28 billion from 14.24 billion.
    Taking into account expenditure on major energy project
debt totalling 2.28 billion, as against nothing in the earlier
period, total net expenditure was 19.57 billion dlrs.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in a statement the
deficit was on course for the yearend forecast.
    Douglas said, "Net expenditure to this point in the year was
about as we would have expected it to be, while revenue was
slightly ahead of forecast."
    He said, "Revenue before provisional tax flows is looking
encouraging at this stage in the year."
    But he said considerable uncertainty remains about the
yearend revenue result, because of difficulty predicting the
size of March tax collections.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to
help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market.
    It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one
adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase
agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542
mln stg from the Bank.
    Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill
takeup would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and
a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln
respectively. Above target bankers balances would add 10 mln.

<TITLE>TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwans new controls on currency
inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood
of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge
against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.
    The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one
mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and
bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any
other source.
    Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to
genuine commercial transactions.
    Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all
outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,
insurance and royalties, to the central bank.
    But bankers said they believed the new controls would be
ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into
smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwans
flourishing currency black market.
    The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a
panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the
past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to
slow the growth of Taiwans exports to the U.S.
    The government has denied local press reports Washington is
pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.
    The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.
    "I dont think the central bank has a final target," said an
executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said
they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the
Taiwan dollar will rise.
    Taiwans trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.
Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus
widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion
dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.
    Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative
money flowed into Taiwan in 1986.
    This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more
than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last
year and provided further upward pressure on the currency.
    The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against
the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging
speculators.
    Central bank governor Chang Chicheng said last week
Washingtons pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves
meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.
    Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the
currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow
the local dollar to find its own level.
    "Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the
central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want
to take the risk," said one local banker.
    He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary
measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with
the exchange rate problem.
    The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt
around the real issue, he said.
    Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign
exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.
    "The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank
charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation," said the
manager of a European bank.
    Economists criticised the controls, saying they could
antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic
liberalisation in Taiwan.
    "Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has
restricted inflows," said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers
da Costa.
    A local banker, who declined to be named, said, "Its
basically ridiculous. Its a backward movement and goes against
the governments liberalisation programme."
    Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to
enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,
treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow
individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country
each year.

<TITLE>DUTCH SUGAR TRADE DENY INVOLVEMENT IN OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch sugar traders deny involvement
in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to
intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders
told Reuters.
    Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to
intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders
said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by
the Belgian industry.
    "We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German
and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"
a spokesman said.
    EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned
to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German
traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade
sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to
110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.
    The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy
and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this
is the only way in which they can really register their
protest.
    "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of
this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the threeweek
breathing space allowed."

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plc ltBTY.L>
expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87
financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said
in a third quarter statement.
    Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86
financial year, pretax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from
1.48 billion in the previous period.
    Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine
months, while most customers were able to maintain their normal
level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers.
    The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for
the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to
corporation tax and dividend payments.
    Earlier, the company reported third quarter pretax profit
for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with
452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pretax was 1.51 billion stg
against 1.35 billion.
    British Telecom shares were last quoted at 2461/2p, level
with late yesterday, in the wake of results which were in line
with market expectations, dealers said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Australia expects meat and livestock
exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this
year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock
Corp, Peter Frawley, said.
    He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and
less competition from the European Community should lead in the
Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000
tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year.
    "In the last three to four months there has been a
resurgence of inquiries," he said.
    Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market
potential.
    On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European
Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help
Australian sales.
    The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these
markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of
supply, and Australia was "now back in," Frawley said.
    He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the
Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for twothirds
of meat export value to the area, would be maintained.
    He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand
for fresh meat.
    The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia,
the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with
2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain fell, however.
    Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been
offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean.
    Other than livestock, Australias overall meat sales to the
Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes
the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of
mutton and lamb to Iran.
    Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being
virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several
years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a
barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash.
    Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were
currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter
provisions, he said.
    Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand
for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he
predicted this would continue.
    "The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now
Australias largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in.
Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if
the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young
product," he said.

<TITLE>SCANDINAVIA PROPOSES DEREGULATING U.S. AIR FARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Denmark, Norway and Sweden have jointly
proposed deregulating air fares between Scandinavia and the
U.S. In exchange for greater access to the domestic U.S.
Airline market, Norwegian officials said.
    The proposal, handed to federal aviation authorities in
Washington by a delegation from the three countries transport
ministries, was seen in the industry as a major concession to
demands by U.S. Airlines to deregulate air fares to
Scandinavia.
    The scheme in return requests the ltScandinavian Airlines
System>, owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norways governments, be
allowed to compete freely and fairly in the U.S. Market.
    SAS, the only Scandinavian airline flying transatlantic
routes to the U.S., Is currently allowed to land at only four
U.S. Cities and has no commercial routes within the U.S.
    SAS has long held that regulations allowing U.S. Airlines
connecting flights from international to regional airports
within Scandinavia have given these companies an advantage
denied to SAS in the United States.
    Initial U.S. Reaction to the proposal has been positive,
officials said. Industry sources added that if approved, the
scheme would likely lower air fares dramatically between
Scandinavia and the U.S.

<TITLE>LYONNAISE DES EAUX FORECASTS 1987 PROFIT RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Consolidated attributable net profit of
Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux ltLYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least
10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986,
Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.
    Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7
mln reported for this year, while group investments should
total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion
annual average of the past three years, he added.
    Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the groups
leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod
said.
    In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development
with Club Mediterranee ltCMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare
pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern
Central France, he said.
    Whollyowned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement
Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial
planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med
as operator of the complex, he said.
    He gave no financial details but said leisure sector
investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next
three years.
    Investments in the communications industry would go mainly
to develop the groups cable television activities and its 25
pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently
won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in
France.
    Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln
francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux
would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.
    Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience
share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television
advertising market.
    Total investment by the group in the communications sector,
including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400
mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the
coming year.
    Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln
and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the
audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting
turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

<TITLE>GERMAN IBM REPORTS NINE PCT DROP IN TURNOVER IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>IBM Deutschland GmbH ltIBM.F>, the
West German subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp
ltIBM.N>, said its turnover fell nine pct to 12.0 billion marks
in 1986 as a result of currency factors, weaker demand in the
second half and stiff price competition.
    IBM Deutschland planned to strengthen its software and
service activities in future to ensure growth remained at
desired levels in the medium term, managing board chairman
HansOlaf Henkel said. He gave no 1986 profit figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 12.7 pct to 7.2 billion marks while
exports declined 3.2 pct to 4.8 billion.
    Most of IBM Deutschlands exports go to IBM companies in
other countries.
    Henkel said volume sales had been positive overall,
especially in the large computer and personal computer sectors.
However, at the same time, fierce international competition,
worldwide overcapacity and currency movements had reduced large
computer prices for IBM Deutschland by some 23 pct.
    In January Henkel said the annual growth rate of the German
computer market may in the long term be less than 10 pct, well
below the 20 pct expansion originally forecast.

<TITLE>JAPAN READY TO DISCUSS BANK REGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is ready to discuss bank
regulation and capital adequacy with western monetary
authorities but cannot say when or how joint rules can be
agreed, Japanese viceminister of finance for international
affairs Toyoo Gyohten said.
    He told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets that
Japan viewed a January outline agreement between the Bank of
England and U.S. Regulatory authorities as "significant."
    The accord, setting joint rules on capital adequacy, was
criticised in financial markets for excluding Japan, thus
putting U.S. And U.K. Banks at a disadvantage to Japanese banks
    "I am pleased to say that we are prepared to work with
British and American regulators," Gyohten said.
    He added that preliminary contacts had already been made in
the margin of the Bank for International Settlements BIS in
Basle where central bank governors of western nations meet
every month.
    But proper negotiations were still some way off. "We have to
start learning about the different situations in each country
before we can start working towards joint rules," he said.
    "I cant predict when or how we will reach conclusions," he
added.

<TITLE>GERMAN PUBLIC AUTHORITY BUNDESBANK HOLDINGS FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The net position of federal states
worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net
holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank
said.
    States cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln
and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900
mln marks more than in the prior week.
    By contrast, however, the federal government was able to
reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks
to 900 mln.
    Despite the stronger states net needs in the week, their
cash position and other market dependent influences just about
balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through
an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said.
    Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week
to 122.9 billion.
    Liquidity also came in through the maturing of shortterm
treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week.
    Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks
to 109.9 billion. Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were
largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net
currency reserves of 400 mln to 87.0 billion, it said.
    The Bundesbank said its balance sheet total fell by 3.77
billion in the week to 218.45 billion.

<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to grow sugar beet on
105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in
1986, the official MTI news agency said.
    Diplomats said this reflected Hungarys policy of keeping
the sugar beet area stable under the current fiveyear plan
198589 and producing enough to cover only domestic demand
despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.
    Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07
mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet
kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in
Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Swedens second largest bank Svenska
Handelsbanken ltSHBS.S> said it will launch trading in share
futures with fixed maturity dates from March 19.
    Trading will start in four stocks  Svenska Cellulosa AB
ltSCAB.S> SCA, Forsakrings AB Skandia ltSKDS.S>, AB Volvo
ltVOLV.S> and Pharmacia AB ltPHAB.S>. Each futures contract is
for 1,000 shares and with fixed terms of three and six months.
    The bank did not say whether the futures instruments will
be open to foreign investors, who are only allowed to own
socalled unrestricted shares in Swedish companies.
    The Swedish Central Bank last month gave the goahead for
foreigners to trade in share options, but said such approval
will only be given on an individual basis.
    The Handelsbanken scheme, aimed at mainly institutional
investors, is only the latest of several novelties introduced
on Swedens fastgrowing financial markets in recent years.
    The countrys private options exchange is already the
worlds fifth largest and tomorrow a rival market, the Sweden
Options and Futures Exchange SOFE, will begin trading.
    SOFE will also launch a market for share index futures this
spring.

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The tin price is likely to rise to
20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers accord on
export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell
the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin
said.
    The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers
interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to
90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes
overhang.
    It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay
at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors
and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively
unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.
    The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help
push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.
    A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the
ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin
cheaper in sterling terms, it added.
    "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin
market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a
price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.

    According to the report, monitored by the British

    A blast on February 26 ended a 19month unilateral test

<TITLE>CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>China has closed the second round of
bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,
the China Daily has reported.
    It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil
Corp CNOOC as saying China signed eight contracts with 15
foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
    Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
well has so far produced results  Lufeng 1311, 250 km
southeast of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
    The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
terminated after no oil was discovered.
    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore
China since 1979.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to
postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,
Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.
    He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks is
to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean
economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments
on the foreign debt during the present year."
    The statement referred only to payments due to private
foreign banks, a senior government finance official told
Reuters.
    These creditors hold twothirds of Ecuadors foreign debt
which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.
    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments
and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder
of Ecuadors foreign debt, the official said.
    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450
and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and
about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.
    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from
multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here
soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.
    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40
foreign governments.
    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987
budget from last Thursdays earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Ecuadors total service on the foreign debt was
about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.
    The quake ruptured Ecuadors main oil pipeline, suspending
crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil
accounts for up to twothirds of its total exports and up to 60
pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended
interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.
    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a
cashflow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,
which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.
    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact
every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its
14bank advisory committee, the senior government finance
official said. The committee represents the countrys 400 or so
private foreign bank creditors.
    Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks should
perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with
what was forseen."
    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line
with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options
of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."
    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private
foreign banks.
    Ecuadors initial proposal earlier this year was to make
only one semiannual or one annual interest payment this year.
    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments
until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government
officials here said.
    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with
the advisory committee in New York in January, but the
negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12hour
kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force
paratroopers.
    The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least
4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.

<TITLE>LEIGHPEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   LONDON, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin LeighPemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries annual
dinner.
    LeighPemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders  who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," LeighPemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
of a takeover has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    LeighPemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
companys management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the shortterm, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highlycharged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility  even if
it entails opprobrium  for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last weeks earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuadors export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuadors South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  PARIS BOURSE REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Malcolm Whittaker and Franck Pauly, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>French stockbrokers will lose their
jealously guarded 180yearold monopoly of share trading over
the next five years under reforms announced on Tuesday by
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur.
    But with the prospect of fresh money flooding into their
seriously undercapitalised share trading business, there were
few signs of regret over the gradual passing of an era.
    "It is a question of survival after Londons Big Bang," said
private market analyst Edouard Cointreau.
    Balladur said the longexpected reform of the Bourse
structure will progressively allow domestic and foreign banks
to buy stakes in stockbrokers capital, while at the same time
brokers will be allowed access to the money markets.
    The project foresees free access to the Bourse by January
1, 1992, the date set for the opening of a unified European
financial market.
    The planned reform, expected to be put before Parliament
before the end of the Spring session, will open up the capital
of the 45 Paris and 15 regional stockbroker houses in three
stages beginning on January 1 next year.
    The aim of the move, following the examples of Tokyo and
London in opening up their tightlycontrolled membership, was
"to take up the challenge of European financial integration and
fierce international competition," Balladur announced.
    Cointreau, founder and chairman of the private market
analysis company Centre dObservation et de Prospective
Sociales COPS, said the reform was a natural development.
    "The Paris market is rising but that cannot go on for ever.
The brokers know its a good time to sell part of their
business," he told Reuters.
    The reform was inevitable given the European Community
directive, said Ben Williams of Paris brokerage house
FauchierMagnan. "From a French point of view one cannot be very
disappointed," he said, "but some brokers must be a bit worried
as it is not entirely evident that all brokerage houses are
worth a lot of money."
    He said that with the expansion of the market generally
here quality brokerage staff would do very well out of the
reforms in salary terms. "But on the whole expertise is not very
deep and the banks already have a lot of such expertise."
    Dealers agreed generally that by allowing brokers to
reinforce their equity capital, the reform was expected to
improve their ability to take large positions in stocks and
bolster the liquidity of the Paris market.
    The French Banking Association, grouping domestic and
foreign banks operating here, welcomed the reforms. French
banks, which only won direct access to the bond markets last
September, have never been happy with the stockbrokers
continuing monopoly on share trading.
    Brokers said it was too soon to say what form links with
other foreign brokerage houses and banks might take. "Nobody is
willing to talk about this yet but one can be sure that
alliances have been formed over the past years," Williams said.
    Some brokers said the opening up of their capital to banks
could pose questions such as whether the major banks might all
aim for stakes in the most prestigious and bestperforming
brokerage houses, or whether the smaller houses might be
targetted for swallowing up to give banks an easy entry onto
the Bourse.
    Individual banks were reticent over likely strategy with
their future partners. "Discussions will get underway soon but
no specific choice of broker has been made yet," a spokesman
for Credit Lyonnais who declined to be named said.
    Balladurs project does not touch on dealing commissions
but many dealers said the question had to be addressed since
current bank commission was higher than that of brokers because
banks, who cannot deal directly in shares, have to pay a fee to
the broker they use for customer trading.
    According to a study by the Bourse official watchdog body
COB in January, dealing fees on a transaction in shares for a
gross total of 1,000 francs were 14.86 pct if the order was
placed directly by a broker, against 20.79 pct for the same
order passed through a bank.
    Xavier Dupont, Chairman of the Stockbrokers Association,
said the reform would not mean an end to the fixed scale of
commissions. He said the overall reform would give the French
financial markets a "dynamic and efficient organisation." But as
both brokers and bankers commented, "lets wait and see."

<TITLE>JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG ltJACZ.Z> hopes for
another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
companys target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
billion francs was due to currency factors.
    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
group.
    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
pct against 25.3 pct.
    Pohl said the groups average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
writeoffs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
increase in tax levels was expected in future.
    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
the previous year.

<TITLE>JAPAN FIRM PLANS TO SELL U.S. FARMLAND TO JAPANESE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MORIOKA, Japan, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A Japanese real estate company
said it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farming
areas to rich Japanese.
    Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres
of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early
April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of
America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.
    American farmers would continue as working tenants and part
of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges
would go to the Japanese investors as rental.
    Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters sales
were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.
    "Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"
said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. "However, sale
of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,
so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to
own farm land come true."
    Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To
sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face
difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture.

<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taft Broadacasting Co said its
board of directors unanimously decided not to accept the
pending buyout proposal of ltTheta Corp>, an investor group led
by Dudley Taft.
    The decision was based on, among other things, the advice
of its financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and Co, that the offer
of 145 dlrs per share was inadequate.
    Taft said the board concluded that the offer failed to
recognize fully the future propsects of the company and
directed management to explore alternatives including possible
financial restructuring.

<TITLE>DRESDNER BANK UNIT SAYS NOT WORRIED ON BRAZIL DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>DeutschSuedamerikanische Bank AG, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG ltDRSD.F>, said it
was not worried about Brazil stopping its interest payments.
    Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that
Brazils example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin
American countries.
    He pointed out that the regions debt rose by only 2.8 pct
last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries efforts
to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were "not
unsuccessful." But the slump in oil prices and the decline in
commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said.
    Latin American countries exports fell last year by about
16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to
around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said.
    The regions 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated
15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil
exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages
gained by the regions oil importing states, he noted.
    The regions principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each
owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed
by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33
billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt.
    DeutschSuedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT in mid 1986,
which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger
extent into the world economy.
    However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor
countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said.
    In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was
imperative, he said.
    The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an
important additional step towards debt consolidation.
    West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in
1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to
1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks,
Mittendorf said.
    Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were
also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil
rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina
went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to
Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.
    Brazil was West Germanys main Latin American supplier, but
shipments fell to 4.4 billion marks from 6.4 billion in 1985.

<TITLE>U.K. GILT MARKET TURNOVER EASES IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Turnover in the U.K. Government bond
gilt market in February slipped to 81.25 billion stg from
Januarys 83.37 billion, although it was 165 pct higher than
the 30.63 billion in February 1986, the Stock Exchange said.
    The Stock Exchange noted, however, that turnover between
bond marketmakers through the interdealer broker IDB screen
system, as distinct from business with outside clients, has
only been included from October 1986, meaning that prior data
is not strictly comparable with recent figures.
    The contribution to overall February, 1987 volume from IDB
 business was 43.10 billion stg, against 43.19 in January.
    In the 20 trading days of February, the average daily
volume of business was 4.06 billion stg, against an average of
3.97 billion in January, which had 21 trading days.
    Total Stock Exchange turnover for the month was 116.73
billion stg, marginally higher than the 116.65 billion recorded
in January but 129 pct more than the 50.92 billion of February
1986.

<TITLE>SOUTHWEST REALTY ltSWL> HAS LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes it
could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
making the payments would probably severely impair its
liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
its properties.
    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
properties is due to mature on April One.
    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
the properties.
    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
    The company said depending on the success of the talks and
operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
at yearend, Southwest said.

<TITLE>JACOBS SUCHARD SEES 100,000 TONNE COCOA SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa
surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a
104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity
buying, told a news conference.
    The company expects prices to remain at around current
levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock
rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes
market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise
prices.
    Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak
if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.
    Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction
will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a
continued buildup in stocks.
    The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised
market observers.
    Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to
the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free
and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for
their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka
added.

Watsonville Canning and Frozen Foods, one of Californias
largest food processors, ended with workers overwhelmingly

    More than 1,000 workers walked off their jobs in September
1985 after Watsonville Canning cut their wages from 6.66 dlrs
an hour to 4.85 dlrs.
    Watsonville declared bankruptcy last week and the cannery
was taken over by Norcal Frozen Foods Inc., a consortium of
growers. A spokeswoman for Teamsters Local 912 said the workers
voted 54321 in favor of a new contract.
    The Norcal offer provides a 5.85 dlrsperhour wage with no

<TITLE>U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billion
dlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29
billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in January
sales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The department
previously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct.
    Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct
after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.
    Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revision
downward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealer
sales figure than originally estimated.
    Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a
14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by
27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than
the 22.4 pct fall originally reported.
    The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax
laws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in January
sales, department spokesmen said.
    Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72
billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January.
    Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling
by 1.7 pct in January.
    Nondurable goods sales rose by 1.3 pct to 75.58 billion
dlrs in February after falling by 0.2 pct in January, the
department said.
    General merchandise stores rose 1.4 pct after increasing
sales by 1.6 pct in January, and department stores were up two
pct in February after rising 1.5 pct in January.
    Food store sales increased 0.4 pct after declining by 1.0
pct in January, while grocery store sales increased 0.3 pct in
February after falling 0.6 pct in January.
    Gasoline service station sales rose 2.0 pct in February
after a 1.9 pct January increase.
    Apparel store sales were up 0.8 pct last month after
falling 3.0 pct in January, while sales at eating and drinking
places increased 1.5 pct after rising 0.5 pct in January.
    Februarys retail sales were 4.4 pct above the yearago
level of 117.09 billion dlrs, the department said.

<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taft Broadcasting Co vice chairman
Dudley Taft and Narragansett Capital Inc ltNARR> said they
intend to pursue their effort to acquire Taft Broadcasting
despite the rejection yesterday of their 145 dlr per share
offer by the Taft Broadcasting board.
    Dudley Taft and Narragansett, in a joint statement, said
they intend to explore alternatives to achieve the acquisition,
including further talks with Taft Broadcasting.
    They said they are confident that the Taft Broadcasting
board will conclude that the resolution of the companys
current "unstable situation" as quickly as possible is in the
best interests of all parties.
    They said the Taft board did not conclude that their offer
was not fair to Taft shareholders.  Taft Broadcasting
yesterday, however, said financial advisor Goldman, Sachs and

<TITLE>CBT HEAD SAYS POSITION LIMITS HAVE NO PURPOSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Bruce Clark, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, CFTC, should increase speculative position limits
on agricultural futures and do away with them for financial
futures, Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, chairman Karsten Mahlmann
said.
    Reporting to the CFTC Financial Products Advisory Committee
on the conclusions so far of an ad hoc CBT committee on
offexchange trading issues, Mahlmann said, "We came to the
conclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculative
position limits."
    Position limits were supposed to prevent market
manipulation, but "I would submit that the Exchange and the
CFTC currently have all the tools necessary to prevent market
manipulation, whether an account is speculative or a hedge,"
the CBT chairman said.
    Malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the CBT
because the exchange faced increasing competition from foreign
markets, most of which did not have position limits.
    He said the ad hoc committee, which he also chairs, had
agreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded to
include risk management as well as risk reduction.
    Mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category of
trading was given a name such as "nonspeculative hedging,"
insurance companies and pension funds might be held back from
engaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern such
entities.
    The ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of
"prudence guidelines" and a list of market activities that fell
within those lines which might be lengthened in the future, he
said.
    The committee might also propose that CBT itself be allowed
to enforce position limits on agricultural futures, he added.

<TITLE>CANADA LEADERS FAIL TO SET PACT ON FREE TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he
held "frank" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on
the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the
longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be
settled.
    Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings
with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would
be held in June and September to discuss the role of the
provinces in approving any new trade deal.
    But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping
talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years
ago.
    "It appears reasonable progress is being made in the
talks," Mulroney said.
    Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, "Things are running pretty
quickly now."
    The talks, launched by Mulroneys Progressive Conservative
government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the
U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the
worlds largest trading partnership.
    But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any
new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders
complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification
formula.
    "Its my view that we should be thinking about these things
right now, along with the questions of the substance of the
agreement," commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has
been highly critical of the talks in the past.
    But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement
was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no
need for a "hard and fast formula."
    Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make
concessions to the United States on financial services in order
to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.
    Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say
the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it
will involve eliminating border tariffs and many nontariff
barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
    A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to
the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is
hoped to be presented to Congress in October.
    "Its a very tight time frame," Ontarios Peterson said last
night. "But at this moment it is tough to say what will
transpire."

<TITLE>BALDRIGE OPPOSES JAPANESE PURCHASE OF FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and
semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S.
officials said.
    The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday
that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics
firm.
    The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it
could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign
/ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its
advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
gathering.
    In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the
already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan
stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.
    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
sale in the coming weeks, they said.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergers position was not
immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer
of high technology to foreign governments and companies.
    Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S.
manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none
have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese
governmentrun agencies and universities.

<TITLE>SAND TECHNOLOGY ltSNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Solange De Santis</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 11  </DATELINE><BODY>Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is
considering a reverse stock split of at least onefor10 and
expects to report a secondquarter profit, compared to a loss
last year.
    The stock consolidation "is something were discussing, but
its not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
told Reuters in an interview.
    A private placement recently brought the number of
outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
    "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,"
Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
    Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
    Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
dlrs in the second quarter.
    After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break even
in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
    The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
Canadian dollars last year led to Sands loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
    In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
dlrs.
    Shattner believes the company will post better results this
year due to several factors.
    "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
second quarter," he said.
    Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
accessories such as disk drives, solidstate memory enhancement
devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd ltHIT> of
Japan.
    Shattner said Sands affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
handle large databases and share them between applications.
    It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
corporations.
    The company has also reduced costs through some staff
cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.
    And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
fiscal quarter, Shattner said.

<TITLE>JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The worst may be just about over for
Japans battered economy but economists said they do not expect
a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists
polled by Reuters said the economys 18 monthold slowdown is
likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising
exports, steppedup government spending and falling prices. "The
economy will bottom out in the middle of the year," said
Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.
    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu
Taketomi agreed. "It the bottom is in the offing," he said.
    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the
fiscal year beginning next month will only pickup 2.2 pct,
from two pct in the current year, he said.
    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst
are increasing.
    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year
rose slightly on a yearonyear basis, after declining toward
the end of last year.
    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a
sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,
several economists said it could mark the beginning of a
recovery.
    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller
than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3
pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey
released last week showed that the decline in Japanese
corporate earnings may be nearing its end.
    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes
the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.
    Six nations  the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany  pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    The yens 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
years has hit the exportdriven economy hard, by forcing its
companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.
    "The important thing is the exchange rate," Taketomi said.
    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs
of that yet, economists said.
    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to
recover, economists said.
    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some
loosening of the governments tight fiscal policy said Haruo
Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    The next reading of the economys health should come early
next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,
1986.
    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from
the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.
    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
quarteronquarter. But he added that would be a statistical
aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.
    To maintain yearonyear growth of around 2.5 pct, the
economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth
quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.
     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
1986, the official said.
    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
distorted by the governments sale of gold coins in the second
half of 1986.
    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their
purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December
because of bad weather and smallerthannormal endyear
bonuses, they said.
    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
retailers because they were unsold, the governments
contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
boosted, economists said.
    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
year was good.
    The senior government official said the fourth quarter
performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
generally expected, while that of the external sector was
better.

    Qintex said it is extending the offer to allow Princeville
to comply with federal law restricting the ownership of U.S.
airlines by nonU.S. citizens and to finalize the terms and
conditions of the letter of credit or bank guarantee required
under the previously announced acquisition agreement.

<TITLE>BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan imposed currency controls today
in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation
as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.
    The strict controls will require proof that large
remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions
rather than currency speculation.
    Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they
were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster
appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,
which would slow exports to the United States.
    Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,
shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government
approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from
any other source.

<TITLE>TAIWAN TO RELAX IMPORT CURBS ON MORE GOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan will relax import controls on
more foreign goods, a government spokesman said today.
    The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by
overseas trading partners, especially the United States, an
official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
told Reuters.
    Import curbs on about 400 foreign goods, including
stationery and books, would soon be relaxed, he said.
    Taiwan announced it would ease curbs on some 600 farming
and industrial products last month.
    The official said the moves were intended to balance trade
between Taiwan and the United States and other trading
partners. Taiwans trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion
dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.

<TITLE>U.K. RETAILERS SEE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Retailers expect consumer spending
to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in
February, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of
British Industry CBI.
    Fiftynine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the
latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher
in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct
expecting lower sales.
    The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel
Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further
help sales during the summer.
    Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in
January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.
    "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had
expected, and they are now looking for better business in
March," todays survey said.
    It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with
80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.
    Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, while
both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import
penetration, it said.

<TITLE>MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jennie Kantyka, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Most Japanese companies have decided not
to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
prices remain considerably lower than OPECs official levels,
industry sources said.
    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
official price of 17.42 dlrs.
    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
total of about 185,000 barrels per day bpd of Iranian crude
under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
    "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese
refiner said.
    "We dont intend to put pressure on them," he added.
    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
considerably lower, oil traders said.
    They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
likely to recur in April, adding to that countrys surplus.
    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
OPECs December production agreement, while agreeing to the
fixed prices.
    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
its firsthalf 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Seas Brent blend.
    One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment theres a lot of
pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
there will be no problem, and Im beginning to trust their
ability."
    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all
member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
and official selling prices."
    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
return to the market in search of crude.
    A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are
beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."

<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A Swedish virologist unveiled a new AIDS
blood test using synthetic antigens, or substances which
combine with antibodies to make them detectable, which would be
much cheaper and more reliable than existing tests.
    Anders Vahlne said the test, developed at Gothenburg
University, was accurate enough to eliminate the need for a
second test usually carried out to doublecheck those found to
be "AIDS positive," that is with AIDS antibodies in their blood.
    Vahlne said the test could be on the market in between four
and eight months. A small Swiss firm, Virovahl S.A., Helped
finance it.

<TITLE>CME CONTINUES DELIBERATION ON DUAL TRADING BAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange CME adjourned a meeting late last night without
reaching a decision on a petition to ban dual trading in
Standard and Poors 500 stock index futures, an exchange
official said.
    CME president Bill Brodsky told Reuters that the CME board
would meet again today and probably reach a decision either
late today or tomorrow.
    Dual trading involves the right of members to trade for
their own account as well filling orders for customers.
    The petition, signed by several hundred exchange members
when it was circulated on the floor of the CME two weeks ago,
calls for the elimination of dual trading in the S and P pit.
Some industry watchers believe that if the CME eliminates the
practice other exchanges will have to consider such a move.
    The practice has drawn criticism from some sectors in that
it provides an opportunity for abusive practices in which
customer orders are not executed at the best possible price.
    One practice, know as "frontrunning," involves a broker
trading ahead of a large customer order and then profiting by
the impact on the market of the customer order.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The EC Commission said it was
adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production
quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel
products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.
    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the
industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity
by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in
1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.
    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing
quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost
all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.

<TITLE>K MART ltKM> SAYS RECORD 1986 NET "TURNING POINT"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TROY, Mich., March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
a year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the worlds
second biggest retailer.
    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."
    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these
programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
this milestone."
    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
1985, it said.
    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
acceptance of K Marts apparel merchandise, "a marked increase
in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
specialty retailing operations."
    K Mart said its fourth quarter pretax income from
continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
in 1985.
    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
Mart," Fauber said in a statement.
    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
company."
    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
its longterm debt.
    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
for the long term," the K Mart chairman said.

<TITLE>ROCKEFELLER SAYS BRAZIL SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>David Rockefeller, chairman of the
international advisory committee of Chase Manhattan Bank NA,
said an accommodation would be found between Brazil and its
commercial bank creditors to solve the problem of the nations
recent interest payment halt.
    "I think one will find that the banking community, the
Brazilian government and the international banking authorities
will be talking for the next several weeks and I am very
hopeful that we would find an accommodation." Rockefeller told
bankers at a luncheon.
    Brazil announced on February 20 that it was suspending
interest repayments on about 68 billion dlrs of private sector
debt owed to commercial banks.
    Rockefeller said the recent tour by Brazilian Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro of major industrial nations was a sign
that Brazil wanted to be cooperative. But it was notable that
Funaro did not meet with the creditors immediately affected,
the commercial bankers, he added.
    Brazils moratorium on commercial debt becomes critical by
endMay, when payments would be 90 days overdue, obliging U.S.
Regulators to downgrade Brazilian debt, financial sources said.
    This would require banks in turn to cease accruing interest
and set aside expensive loan loss reserves.
    Rockefeller reminded bankers of the depth of concern over
Latin American debt at the Toronto World Bank/International
Monetary Fund meeting in 1982, and said an accord would be
reached in the current circumstances just as it had been then.
    "Brazilian authorities have no more interest in seeing
their credit sources cut off then we have in seeing their
obligations stop," he added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPS ltP> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ted DAfflisio, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize
improving its shortterm cash flow this year to pare its debt,
C.J. "Pete" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.
    "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets
already installed," he said, but he declined to estimate annual
cash flow for 1987.
    Analysts estimate Phillips" cash flow at over one billion
dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from
restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers
about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.
     Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising
the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas
properties.
    "We plan to develop the properties with shortterm high cash
flow prospects," he said. He projected a capital expenditure
budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln
dlrs.
    Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and
production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas
said.
    "Phillips top priority in 1987 will be to get the
waterflooding in Norway and jack up the Ekofisk oil fields to
improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings," Silas
said.
     Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to
cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross
barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.
    Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas
said he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinese
government to make oil discoveries in the offshore Xijang
fields commercially viable."
    In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point
Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. "We
expect to start up the first platform then," Silas said.
    But emphasis on shortterm cash flow has also forced the
company to part with several oil and gas assets.
    Phillips sold its interests in the TBlock in the U.K.
North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in
1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is
now completed, Silas said.
     "We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good
value for us but possibly so for someone else," Silas said.
    Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings
for the company.
    "Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we
are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while
regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt," Silas said.
    He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil
prices dont fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for
several months. "Then, everyone would be looking at sales of
assets, and were no different from the others," Silas said.
    In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from
Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in
earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.
    "This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and
demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs
for our operations," Silas said, "In 1987 we think the markets
supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock
and energy costs will rise due to price recovery."

<TITLE>MERRILL LYNCHltMER> CANADA MULLS BUYING BROKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch Canada Inc, wholly owned
by Merrill Lynch and Co, is considering acquiring another
Canadian securities company as the result of federal and
provincial government moves to lift investment dealer ownership
restrictions on June 30, according to a published report.
    "Were talking to a number of people," Merrill Lynch Canada
deputy chairman E. Duff Scott told The Toronto Star. "Whether
were going to do something, I dont know," he said.
    A Merrill Lynch Canada spokesman declined to comment on the
newspaper report when queried.
    Scott did not disclose which investment dealers Merrill
Lynch Canada was considering acquiring, but the Toronto Star
quoted unidentified industry sources as saying serious
discussions have already been held with Burns Fry Ltd.
    Burns Fry chairman Jack Lawrence told the newspaper the
investment dealer has not made a final decision, but was
examining "three or four alternatives."
    Discussions between brokers about possible mergers is to be
expected pending industry deregulation, one investment industry
source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
    "Its silly not to take a look at making a merger or
acquisition. If youre a businessman, you have to take a look,"
the industry source said.
    Under federal and provincial government regulations
expected to be in place by June 30, banks, trust companies and
foreign companies will be allowed to acquire existing
investment dealers or establish their own securities
subsidiaries.

<TITLE>SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
the kingdoms determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
said.
    They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day bpd including oil from the
neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
of 3.5 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
counted towards a members production quota. Saudi Arabias
quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
    The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
world"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
sources said.
    King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
commitment to OPECs December pact to boost oil prices to an
average 18 dlrs.
    "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," he
said.
    The sources said the kingdoms exports from Gulf ports
averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
    The kingdoms main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
past stakes in the national oil company Aramco  Mobil, Exxon,
Texaco and Chevron  enjoy considerable flexibility in the
timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
official prices, the sources said.
    Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
    They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
obligations.

<TITLE>MONSANTO ltMTC> RESPONDS TO CALL FOR LAWSUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAUGET, ILL., March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Corp said a call by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency requesting the
Illinois Attorney General file a lawsuit against the company is
"inappropriate and counterproductive."
    The company said the suit seeks to force Monsanto to
replace the chlorosulphonic acid cooling system at its William
G. Krummrich plant in Sauget, Ill.
    Monsanto said the basis for the agencys action was an
accident March Three in which the plants acid unit experienced
an emission due to a failed expansion joint in the cooling
system.
    Monsanto said when the environmental agency recommended
that the company replace the present cooling system, it
contacted the manufacturer of the system to seek outside
technical advice.
    Monsanto said its analysis indicated that the present
system represents the safest technology for producing
chlorosulfonic acid, and removal of the system with expansion
joints would increase  not decrease  the chances of further
accidents.

<TITLE>TREASURY OFFICIAL SAYS PHILIPPINE PACT VERY NEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>An agreement in the debt rescheduling
talks between the Philippines and its commercial bank advisory
committee seems to be close at hand, said David Mulford,
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.
    "The Philippines negotiations resumed in early March and
agreement now appears to be very near," Mulford told a debt
conference, organized by the Euromoney magazine.
    Mulford gave no further details. He told reporters after
his speech that he had no information on the banks response to
the Philippines revised proposal, based on partial payment of
interest with investment notes instead of cash.
    Progress in the Philippines talks, following recent
agreements with Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, will help to
dispel concerns of a new debt crisis, Mulford told the
conference.
    However, he said there will continue to be difficulties and
periods of significant risk, requiring creative thinking on the
part of the banks.
    In particular, he urged the banks to develop a "menu of
options for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintaining
broad bank participation in new financing packages."
    Mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range of
options to members of the lending syndicates, provided that the
liquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nations
is equivalent to the banks new money obligation.
    He said it is more important to find ways of encouraging
banks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enabling
them to quit the lending groups.
    Mulford said his menu of options could include more trade
credits, direct portfolio investments, debt/equity swaps,
project loans, cofinancings and the invesmtent note concept,
which has been proposed by the Philippines.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden announced its promised program
of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave
firms an October deadline to cut trading links.
    Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of
South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from
July 1, followed by a threemonth period of grace to give
companies time to wind down their operations.
    From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either
direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies
and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.
    She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a
Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and
disadvantage South Africas blackruled neighbours, the
frontline states.
    Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott
would be based was not impossible to get round. She said a
parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some
of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South
Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.

<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plcs ltBTY.L>
profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
in Britain for three to five years.
    He said ltMercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
Plc ltCAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
of British Telecoms most profitable areas.
    One company official privately estimated that British
Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
    The recent twoandahalfweek engineering strike, which
lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
    However, he forecast that the last quarters results
overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
    But on balance Odgers said that groups financial strength,
economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
forseeable future.
    British Telecom will also seek to expand into
manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
    Analysts said the companys downbeat forecasts helped
shares dip to 242p in midafternoon, down 4p from yesterdays
close and off an early high of 248p.
    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pretax
profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
    Augar noted that a governmentimposed formula linking
charges to inflation meant that the companys scope for raising
prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

<TITLE>NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the
end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.
    IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government
ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess
Brazils position in the light of the failure of talks in
London earlier this month to set new International Coffee
Organization, ICO, export quotas.
    "The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink
its position completely," one Santos exporter said.
    A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for
Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain
his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.
    Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week
that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held
talks with all sectors of the industry.
    Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to
start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been
recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO
talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos
for export in the first four months of this year.
    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening
of May and June export registrations will be the amount at
which the contribution quota is set.
    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms
such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being
introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in
determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world
markets, they said.
    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned
increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and
closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record
amount for a single day.
    If May/June registrations are opened under similar
conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in
selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.
    "The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.
    Brazils present foreign trade and payments problems mean
there are pressures from the government to boost exports to
maximise foreign exchange earnings.
    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a
marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazils dominant
position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.
    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan
to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between
1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to nonmembers of the ICO.
    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around
the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were
reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with
the breakdown of talks.
    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this
year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after
meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.
    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to
consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost
inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to
encroach on other producers markets.
    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly
marketing of traditional amounts, thus reestablishing Brazils
market share after last years unusually low exports of 9.9 mln
bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial
relations with the producer group which backed Brazils stance
at the ICO talks, they added.

<TITLE>REAGAN SENDS CONGRESS FEDERAL CREDIT REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The White House said President
Reagan would send to Congress today proposed legislation
providing for sweeping reform of the budgetary treatment of the
federal credit program.
    Called the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1987, the proposal
consists of a package of legislation and accompanying budget
amendments, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
    He noted that in fiscal 1986 the federal government
disbursed 42 billion dlrs in new direct loans and guaranteed
loans totalling 159 billion dlrs.
    Under the reform bill, Fitzwater said the subsidy element
in direct loan and guaranteed loan programs would be
established and Congress would appropriate the amount of the
subsidy to the lending agency.
    "This is kind of a truth in spending reform package,"
Fitzwater said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Instinet Corp said its board has
scheduled a special shareholders meeting for May 21 to vote on
its proposed merger into Reuters Holdings PLC ltRTRSY>.
    It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be
eligible to vote at the meeting.
    Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment,
based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of
merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before
the end of March.
    Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy
materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial
statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986.
    Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters
tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45
pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the
tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares.
    In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will
receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for
each Instinet share.
    The ADSs will be valued at the average of their closing
prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the
merger.
    Instinet said it expects the merger to become effective as
soon as possible after shareholder approval at the special
meeting.

<TITLE>PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A Portuguese court has made a
preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC
should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders
open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.
    Under the terms of Portugals January 1986 accession to the
European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC
Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais is being reduced
by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.
    Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being
permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first
liberalised 20 pct share of the countrys annual import needs.
The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal
proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.
    Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbons civil
court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be
allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.
    Trade sources said the ruling, though effective
immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be
confirmed in further proceedings.
    A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said
that, as a result of the courts decision, the Commission would
not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being
held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.
    Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPACs
participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of
Portugals EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual
dismantling of the state agencys import monopoly.
    It also said the participation of EPAC, which still
controls the national grain storage and distribution network,
was unfair competition to the private traders.
    Traders said they believed the ECs Executive Commission
was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to
leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.
    "They the EC Commission will be keeping a low profile," one
trader said.
    ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if
necessary.

<TITLE>U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND  ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retail sales rose sharply in
February but many economists said the underlying consumer
spending trend remains weak.
    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.53.0
pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But Januarys
sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously
reported 5.8 pct decline.
    "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
much more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
spending is slowing.
    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November
and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain
over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4
pct rise for yearoveryear sales through February.
    "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldnt
be surprised to see a falloff in March, especially since sales
probably wont be boosted by auto sales as they were in
February."
    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were
impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding
autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline
in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.
    "The increase in nonauto sales was broadbased, with gains
in durable goods as well as nondurables," noted Ward McCarthy
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthy
report."
    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February
after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store
sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.
    "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said.
"But its jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
into the future." 
    A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
spending in February, he said.
    "A lot of people may be inadvertently underwithholding
taxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in this
country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination
is to go out and spend it," he said.
    Economists said tomorrows release of U.S. auto sales for
the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
how much this sector will add to first quarter spending.
     Auto sales accounted for the lions share of total
February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop
in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely
to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
January 1, the Commerce Department noted.
    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the
strength in the February report is less than impressive.
    "There is strength in the February data, but thats because
they were compared to low sales levels in January," said said
Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We dont see it as a
precursor of continued strength."
    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling
17.7 pct in January. February nondurable goods sales gained
1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.
    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,
following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher
oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
probably accounted for these gains.
    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they
fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in
February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.
    "On average, it looks like theyll total 120 to 121 mln
dlrs in the first quartrer," she said. "We dont look at this
as indication that the economy is barrelling along."
    "The number is not really that problematic for those of us
who are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Platt
of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.
    "The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so
confusing," he said.
    "Before the 337,000 gain in February nonfarm payroll
employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in
March," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait for
the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in
April to sort things out."

<TITLE>MAGMA ltMGCPV> SEES PROFITABLE COPPER PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp ltNEM> said Magma
Copper Co anticipates being able to produce copper at a profit
by 1991, assuming copper prices remain at their current levels.
    In an information statement distributed to Newmont
shareholders explaining the dividend of Magma shares declared
Tuesday, Newmont said Magma had a net loss of 46.6 mln dlrs in
1986, adding this was equal to 1.22 cts a share.
    Newmont holders will receive 80 pct of Magmas stock as a
dividend of one share for each of the 30,458,000 Newmont shares
now held. Newmont will retain 15 pct of the stock.
    The 1986 net loss was on a pro forma basis, Newmont said.
On a historical basis, it added, Magma had a 1986 net loss of
58.1 mln dlrs on a loss from operations of 42.3 mln dlrs.
    On Dec 31, 1986, Newmont said, Magma had about 85.0 mln
dlrs of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 19992000
and about 4.0 mln dlrs of investment tax credit carryover
expiring in 20002001.
    Newmont said Magma has pretax losses of 290 mln dlrs
during the 1981 through 1985 period, noting the five major U.S.
primary copper producers reported aggregate pretax losses of
1.9 billion dlrs during five year period.
    Newmont said Magma had total sales of 347.3 mln dlrs last
year, including copper sales of 293.4 mln dlrs.
    It said the copper sales value was up from 267.6 mln dlrs
in 1985 reflecting a 10.1 pct increase in quantity sold to
212,000 short tons and a 0.4 pct decrease in price.

<TITLE>SEC REMOVES OBSTACLE TO FOREIGN FUTURES TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures
on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.
    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to
apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for
approval of a futures contract on yen bonds.
    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond
futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.
    The SECs action, which was approved by a 40 vote,
specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on
designated foreign government debt securities on contract
markets that are not located in the country that issued those
securities.
    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada
and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States
under a designated exemption issued by the SEC.
    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to
the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on
those securities, SEC officials said.
    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government
debt securities to be marketed in the United States by
countries other than those that issued the securities, the
officials said.
    Since the foreign government securities underlying the
futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are
registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures
would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC
officials said.
    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of
additional countries government securities to be marketed and
traded in the United States, the officials said.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SAY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMY GROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Uncertainty is growing about the prospects
for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale
back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro
Association said.
    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while
industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said
in a report.
    However, last months agreement among the six leading
western industrialized countries to keep currencies around
present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for
exporters, it added.
    The banking association said the possibility of using
monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be
overestimated.
    Another small drop in already low interest rates could not
be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of
consumer or capital goods, it said.
    The Bundesbanks halfpoint cuts in the discount and
Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for
any further monetary moves, the association added.
    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross
national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar
adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the
third quarter.
    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP
in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively
weak.
    Bank economists have forecast the economy will either
stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official
firstquarter figures are due in early June.

<TITLE>KODAK ltEK> REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO PHOTOGRAPHY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it will
build a major facility here for the production of color film,
reaffirming its commitment to its core photographic business.
    Kodak said the plant will cost more than 200 mln dlrs to
build and will be staffed by about 250 people who will be
transferred from existing manufacturing operations. It said the
plant should be operational by the fall of 1990.
    Kodak said it does not intend to shut down any current
capacity as anticipated growth in demand for photography
products will "offset the additional capacity."
    The company also said the facility will position it "well
into the 21st century," in the photography business. It said
the plant will initially produce color films for the
professional and motion picture industry.
    Kodak also said it will maintain its Rochester site as the
center of its photographic technology operations. "We have been
encourgaged that in recent years this community and New York
state have been working hard to improve the business climate
for manufucturing," said William F. Fowble, Kodaks sernior
vicepresient and general manager of manufacturing. "We assume
thesse efforts will continue."

<TITLE>INVESTORS TO RAISE CYCLOPS ltCYL> TENDER PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Cyacq Corp, an investor group
bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
    The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
Pittsburghbased maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
products.
    Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
    Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
    For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
Cyacq with all nonpublic information provided to Dixons Group
and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
said.
    Additionally, Dixon Groups rights to buy Cyclops common
and its rights to fees or expenses if the DixonCyclop merger
agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
    Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
were materially lower than the financial projections provided
by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. "We have nothing
in hand," she said.
    In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
    Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and other states. It also has interests in nonresidential
construction.
    In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman
said.
    The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclopss steel
and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany
Corp ltY> for about 110 mln dlrs once the merger is completed.
    A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price
would be all cash. He had no comment on whether Cyacq plans to
withdraw its current offer, which is scheduled to expire
midnight on March six.
    Dixon Groups offer extends to March 17.

<TITLE>U.S. TO ASK FOR SHARE OF JAPANS RICE MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market
to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reagan
administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef
and citrus exports.
    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 1427, said he will
not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. "We will urge
that they consider sharing their rice market," he said.
    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the
Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. "Weve got none of
it now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big
improvement," he said.
    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by
the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import
restrictions.
    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by
mid1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice
exports.
    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations
next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but
that his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talks
prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.
    He said, however, that the U.S. "will ask for a definite
liberalization of those items beef and citrus.... When you
translate liberalization into Japanese, it means do away with
the quota."

<TITLE>UNION PACIFIC ltUNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a
pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacifics Champlin Petroleum
Co subsidiary.
    The sale will also include the related marketing and
distribution system for the refinerys products.
    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
issued later today giving details of the transaction.
    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
York.
    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
transaction.
    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlins operations also fits a
profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corps
ltSLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgos stock.
    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlins Corpus
Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
source of supply, trade sources said.
    In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to
supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
feedstocks.

downgraded Canadas Province of Saskatchewan. The action
affects the equivalent of 1.68 billion U.S. dlrs of debt.
    S and P lowered the provinces longterm debt to AAminus

    The rating agency said the action reflected a substantial
increase in Saskatchewans budget deficit for fiscal 1987 and
prospects for greater taxsupported debt in the medium term.

<TITLE>NIAGARA MOHAWK ltNMK> TO REPLACE NINE MILE VALVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYRACUSE, N.Y., March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Niagara Mohawk Power Co said the
existing balltype main steam isolation valves installed at
Unit Two of the Nine Mile Nuclear Station will be replaced with
standard Ypattern globe valves.
    This decision will delay startup of the power plant for
about three to four months, resulting in a delay in commercial
operation of the plant to as late as the beginning of 1988, the
utility said. It previously had projected commercial operation
in September.
    The possibility of a delay to the first quarter 1988 was
raised by Rochester Gas and Electric Corp ltRGS> last week.
    Niagara Mohawk said the delay will add to the plants cost
at the rate of about 60 mln dlrs per month.
    A spokesman said this includes a total of about 10 mln dlrs
for removing the old valves and buying and installing the new
ones.
    The utility said the total anticipated cost of the plant is
now about six billion dlrs, up from the 5.87 billion dlrs
projected previously.
    This has increased the minimum overall disallowances under
the settlement Nine Mile Twos owners reached with New York
state regulators to over 2.1 billion dlrs, it added.
    Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in Nine Mile Two,
making its share of the disallowance about 1.1 billion dlrs
before income tax effects.
    Long Island Lighting Co ltLIL> and New York State Electric
and Gas Corp ltNGE> each have an 18 pct interest in the plant
while Rochester Gas owns 14 pct and Central Hudson Gas and
Electric Corp ltCNH> has nine pct.
    The ball valves were manufactured by a Gulf and Western Inc
ltGW> subsidiary which is now owned by Crosby Valve and Gauge
Co, a subsidiary of Gearhart Industries Inc ltGOI>, the
spokesman said.
    The Niagara Mohawk spokesman said the Nine Mile Two owners
are looking into the possibility that the valve supplier might
have liability for the costs of the delays caused by the
valves.
    The utility said the replacement valves are manufactured by
Rockwell International Inc ltROK>.
    The company said it spent considerable time testing and
modifying the ball valves which, until recently, "demonstrated
potential for both improvement in performance and in ease of
maintenance."
    "Since activities to date have not yet proven to be
completely successful and because of timing and resulting
additional cost of achieving the leak tightness standard is
uncertain, we have no choice but to replace them," Niagara
Mohawk said of the ball valves.

    The sevenyear bonds totalling 500 mln forints may be taken

    The interest rate will always be 0.5 points above that

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Fabrique Nationale Herstal SA
ltFNHB.BR> said it suffered a net loss of 2.99 billion francs
last year after being hit by strikes, the falling dollar and
declining oil prices.
    An FN statement said the loss, which compared with a 6.8
mln franc profit the previous year, included considerable
charges for restructuring in 1986 and 1987. Without these the
net loss would have been 1.45 billion francs, it said.
    It added that the restructuring plan would allow the firm
to return to long term profitability once it had been approved
by local authorities, banks and the workforce.

<TITLE>WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The National Wildlife Federation 
rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
    The federation, the nations largest conservation group,
said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
    Jay Hair, the federations executive vice president, called
the Interiors research into the effects of development "so
fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
which to make a public policy decision."
    Hair called the departments proposal a "reflection of a
largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in
Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area."
    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
safeguards to protect the areas caribou and muskoxen.
    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
    Hair said Interiors report failed to stress the
probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
    He said Interiors study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
ninemember commission be set up to study all aspects of the
issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
exploration of oil, only that Interiors study was inadquate to
make a sound judgement.
    Congressional observers said that at present there was
little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

<TITLE>FRN MARKET SLUMPS, FIXED RATE EUROBOND TRADE QUIET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dominique Jackson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Eurobond prices in the floating rate
note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point
on some issues.
    "Today has been irrational, irresponsible  possibly the
worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater
market," commented a senior FRN trader at a U.K. Bank.
    Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in
initial trading and market nerves soon infected other
supranational and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the
falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S.
Investment houses.
    The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of
liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the
effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate
issues late last year.
    Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has
been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for
floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to
manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.
    Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under
pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure
to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today.
    Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent
postelectoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a
selloff of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and
markdenominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.
    However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish
issues had been singled out  as the U.S. And Canadian banks
were most recently  as the markets most vulnerable sector.
    "A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak
paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the
domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll
with it," a senior FRN market source explained.
    Although floating paper from betterregarded borrowers such
as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis
points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals
like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said.
    Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And
Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 15/8
point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue.
    FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially
enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in
the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the
one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be
imminent.
    "Retail clients just dont want to know about the floaters
any more so it has degenerated to a wily passtheparcel among
the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the
carpet," another senior FRN trader said.
    "I dont know what is going to happen to the market. It
cant go on like this," he added.
    In the fixedrate sector, trading was dull with the market
still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from
earlier this week although primary market activity slowed
somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported.
    Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from
opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly
large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to
wait for tomorrows producer price and business inventory data.
    A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in
the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees
at close of grey market trade although dealers said the
borrowers frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter
investors.
    The Canadian dollar sector however saw good twoway trade
and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian
dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets.
    Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has
firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end
investors confidence in the currency.
    A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering
the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had
not been ruled out.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no
knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the
cabinet.
    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to
subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the
departments export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. We
havent made a decision on it, havent even talked about it,
havent even looked at it."
    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they
the Soviets would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept
it It would depend on what price they offered."
    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat
was far off the world price.
    Asked about persistent speculation that the administration
would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some people
think theyre doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in
the market."
    Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports
that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S.
wheat subsidy offer was imminent.

<TITLE>NORD EST PLANS 400 MLN FRANC BOND ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Financial and industrial holding company
Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of
400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.
    He told a news conference NordEst expected to receive
approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two
week, when terms would set according to market conditions.
    He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new
investments.
    Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25
francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year
rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.
    Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln
francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against
147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower
profit was mainly due to losses made by steeltube maker
Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.
    Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit
before provisions of around 135 mln francs.

<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>SolvEx Corp said it
successfully completed its oil sands pilot testing program
under its agreement with Shell Canada Limited ltSHC> and
received a 250,000 U.S. dlr bonus payment.
    It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take
over SolvExs 25 pct working interest in the construction of
the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about
62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.
    It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the
Government of Alberta.
    In exchange for Shells participation, SolvEx said Shell
is obligated to pay it an upfront royalty and a running
royalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands
facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil
sands project will be built on Shells oil sand lease about 40
miles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of
northern Alberta.
    SolvEx said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian
dlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the
plant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are
expected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Union Pacific Corp said it will enter
a 5050 partnership with Petroles de Venezuela, PDVSA, to own
and operate Union Pacifics 160,000 barrelperday Corpus
Christi, Texas, oil refinery.
    The assests to be acquired by the partnership are valued at
190 mln dlrs, Union Pacific said.
    Closing is expected to take place in early April and the
venture is to be called Champlin Refining Co.
    The partnership will acquire the refining and distribution
systems currently owned and operated by Champlin Petroleum, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific.
    The venture will acquire the related inventories and the
Champlin trade name, the company said.
    PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the
capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit
facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and
receivables, Union Pacific said.
    Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25year agreement to
supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha
to the refinery at market related prices.
    Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could
supply another 50,000 bpd on similar terms, the company said.
    "This will provide a stable, longterm supply to the
refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic
viability of the plant," a statement issued by Union Pacific
said.
   The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the
company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its
customers.
   Union Pacific said employees of the refinery would be
transfered to the new company and would retain the same
benefits as in the past.

<TITLE>PUROLATOR ltPCC> DIRECTOR QUITS OVER BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A Purolator Courier Corp director
resigned from the companys board, saying he plans to take
steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout
deal already accepted by Purolators board, the company said.
    The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
    "I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
corporation," Gardner said in the letter.
    "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.
    Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
of its U.S. courier division.
    On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
filed a class action suit on behalf of the companys
shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
    The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
just 83 pct of Purolators 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs
in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in
exchange for each share.

<TITLE>MAGMA ltMGCPV> STOCK TRANSFERABILITY LIMITED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp ltNEM> said Magma
Copper Cos certificate of incorporation and bylaws have been
restated to limit the transferability of the companys stock.
    In an information statement on its decision to distribute
Magma stock as a dividend, Newmont said the changes "will
impede any change of control of Magma."
    It said this has been done by authorizing two closses of
common stock  60 mln class A shares with one vote each and
38.1 mln class B shares with four votes each. In the dividend
of one Magma share for each Newmont share outstanding announced
Tuesday, Class B shares are being distributed.
    Newmont is distributing 30,458,100 Magma shares, or 80 pct
of the Class B common, to its shareholders.
    It said this stock will be transferable as Class B stock
until one entity acquires over 10 pct of the shares.
    Any shares over 10 pct of those outstanding will
automatically be changed by the transfer agent to Class A
stock, Newmont said.
    The company said there are two exceptions under the bylaws
 the 15 pct of Magmas stock it is retaining and the 21 pct
which will be held by ltConsolidated Gold Fields PLC> as a
result of its ownership of that portion of Newmont.
    However, Newmont Secretary Roger Adams said, any additional
Magma shares acquired by Newmont or Consolidated will
automatically become Class A shares.
    None of the authorized Class A shares is being distributed
at this point, Newmont said.
    The company also said five pct of Magmas stock is being
held in trust for members of Magmas management.
    Newmont said Magmas restated certificate of incorporation
also limits change in control of the company by dividing the
board into three classes serving staggered terms.
    Newmont said the new Magma rules also provide that
shareholder action can be taken only at shareholder meetings,
prohibiting shareholder action by written consent, and include
"fair price" provisions limiting combinations with any holder
of more than 10 pct of Magmas voting power.

<TITLE>U.S.SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he was not sure a longterm U.S.Soviet grain
agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.
    "It hasnt been worth much in the last two years....They
havent lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in an
interview with Reuters.
    "It would be my thought that its not worth any effort to
work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to
be a onesided thing," he said.
    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitive
commitment one way or another at this point."
    Under the accord covering 198388, the Soviets agreed to
buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln
tonnes each of corn and wheat.
    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of
wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last
September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.
    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow
would buy this year.
    "Ive seen people making comments on that and I dont know
how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I have
no knowledge, and I really dont think anyone other than the
Soviets have any knowledge."
    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last
month because "they needed it and because the price was right."
    "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think
theyve always found that our corn was good," he said.

<TITLE>MOROCCO SECURES BULK OF EXTRA AID SOUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Morocco is likely to get an extra aid
package exceeding 100 mln Special Drawing Rights 126 mln dlrs
in 1987 following a threeday Consultative Group meeting of
donors chaired by the World Bank, Moroccan Finance Minister
Mohamed Berada said.
    Berrada said most of the extra aid sought to complete high
priority investments in agriculture, education, and public
health had already been secured, and additional sums were
likely to emerge from forthcoming bilateral meetings with
donors.
    A World Bank statement said the Consultative Group meeting
attended by 15 donor countries and agencies noted with
satisfaction a marked improvement in Moroccos economic
performance and urged it to continue recent adjustment efforts.
    It added that the Group saw as realistic Moroccos
mediumterm goal of restoring creditworthiness on financial
markets, and agreed to reconvene in a year to discuss Moroccos
five year development strategy for 198892, introduced in its
broad outlines at this weeks meeting.
    Morocco reached an agreement here last week with the Paris
Club of western creditor governments to reschedule over 10
years the 900 mln dlrs of debt due by mid 1988. That followed
an agreement late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt.
    Moroccos foreign debt currently totals 14 billion dlrs,
Berrada said, adding that Morocco intended to stop rescheduling
its debts, and pay them off instead.
    He told Reuters the forthcoming fiveyear development plan,
designed to avoid the negative effects of adjustment without
growth, could require further aid of 700 or 800 mln dlrs.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
said it was unable to explain a sharp rise in its stock.
    National Distillers rose 31/8 to 633/4 in moderate
trading of 84,000 shares. Texas investor Robert M. Bass
recently filed a 13D with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, disclosing a stake of more than five pct.
    John Salisbury, vice president and general counsel of
National Distillers, said there were no new developments
concerning Bass. Salisbury also said the company continues
efforts to sell its liquor business and several potential
buyers have inspected the properties.
    Robert Reitzes, analyst at Mabon, Nugent and Co, said
National Distillerss wine and liquor business combined might
be sold for between 600 and 700 mln dlrs. The company completed
sale of its Almaden wine business to Heublein Inc earlier this
week but did not disclose any figures. Heublein is owned by
Grand Metropolitan plc.
    Reitzes said he reiterated a buy recommendation on the
stock yesterday, calling it the biggest commodity chemical play
in the industry. He said recently increased polyetylene prices
appear to be holding.

<TITLE>U.S. SOYBEAN MARKETING LOAN NOT NEEDED  LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present
purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.
    Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a
marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I dont think so. I
dont think the world price is lower than our price anyway."
    However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions
of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to
consider a marketing loan.
    "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our
exports will continue to drop and that the government will
continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "It
might be worth contemplating a marketing loan, if there were

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The United States made its proposals
for verifying adherence to a prospective treaty on medium range
nuclear weapons and in a highly unusual move made public the
outlines of its recommendations.
    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters
the proposals were made to the Soviet Union at Geneva arms
control talks today.
    The proposals included onsite inspection that could result
in inspectors from the two superpowers being stationed

<TITLE>MOROCCO SECURES BULK OF EXTRA AID SOUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Morocco is likely to get an extra aid
package exceeding 100 mln Special Drawing Rights 126 mln dlrs
in 1987 following a threeday Consultative Group meeting of
donors chaired by the World Bank, Moroccan Finance Minister
Mohamed Berada said.
    Berrada said most of the extra aid sought to complete high
priority investments in agriculture, education, and public
health had already been secured, and additional sums were
likely to emerge from forthcoming bilateral meetings with
donors.
    A World Bank statement said the Consultative Group meeting
attended by 15 donor countries and agencies noted with
satisfaction a marked improvement in Moroccos economic
performance and urged it to continue recent adjustment efforts.
    It added that the Group saw as realistic Moroccos
mediumterm goal of restoring creditworthiness on financial
markets, and agreed to reconvene in a year to discuss Moroccos
five year development strategy for 198892, introduced in its
broad outlines at this weeks meeting.
    Morocco reached an agreement here last week with the Paris
Club of western creditor governments to reschedule over 10
years the 900 mln dlrs of debt due by mid 1988. That followed
an agreement late last year to reschedule 1.8 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt.
    Moroccos foreign debt currently totals 14 billion dlrs,
Berrada said, adding that Morocco intended to stop rescheduling
its debts, and pay them off instead.
    He told Reuters the forthcoming fiveyear development plan,
designed to avoid the negative effects of adjustment without
growth, could require further aid of 700 or 800 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>DATA TAPES ERASED IN VW FRAUD, CHAIRMAN SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG ltVOWG.F> supervisory
board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said entire data tapes had
been erased and complete programs altered in forged
transactions amounting to around 480 mln marks.
    "In this case a degree of criminal energy has been brought
into play which until now was unimaginable in a German company,"
he said in a radio interview.
    He could not completely rule out the possibility that
losses would exceed 500 mln marks, but said there were
currently no signs that they would be higher than the 480 mln
announced on Tuesday.
    Some 70 to 80 mln marks had probably been lost through
disregard for internal instructions, he added, but did not
elaborate. However, the remainder had definitely been lost
through criminal action and forgery in 1984.
    Ratjen said the affair would lead to consequences up to the
board room. He would recommend that those under suspicion of
being involved in criminal acts would have to go immediately.
    Those who had not exercised checking functions sufficiently
would also have to go.
    But Volkwagen management board chairman Carl Hahn was not
involved in the affair, he said.
    A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had made sufficient
provision in previous years to cover the losses from the fraud.
Its 1986 profit would, therefore, match 1985 world group net
profits of 595.6 mln marks.
    Volkwagen disclosed the existence of the fraud on Tuesday,
saying it was possible that documents about currency hedging
had been falsified and that those responsible may have come
from outside Volkswagen and may have been assisted by company
staff.
    Criminal complaints on suspicion of fraud, breach of trust
and forgery of documents had been filed, it added.
    The company spokesman said the supervisory board would meet
on April 9 to examine the precise extent of the losses and to
approve the yearend results.
    Ratjen said it was important for Volkwagen to maintain a
degree of "internal integrity" on account of its 200,000
employees, particularly as shop floor elections were coming up.
    "On the one hand one fights for every single mark of income.
And here is a case where hundreds of millions are being just
thrown away," he added.

<TITLE>IMF, DEVELOPMENT BANKS, TO ASSIST ECUADOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>It could be months before major
assistance is provided for Earthquakestricken Ecuador,
although the International Monetary Fund and the development
banks have already taken the first steps, monetary sources and
U.S. officials said.
    They said the IMF had informed the Ecuadorean government
that it was prepared, under its emergency system, to provide
about 50 mln dlrs, or about 25 per cent of the countrys quota
in the agency, but it is up to Ecuador to request the money.
    At the same time, the World Bank and the InterAmerican
Development Bank have dispatched missions to the region hit by
last Thursdays quake to determine what the countrys needs are
and how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programs
already approved.
    The World Bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrs
it has approved for Ecuador in recent years, some 277 mln dlrs
has yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could,
potentially, be made available.
    The bank said that the programs it has approved are for
rural development, agriculture, water and sewerage, electrical
power and others.
    If the assistance that is needed can be fit into these
general categories, the funds could be then provided for from
expedited disbursements

<TITLE>RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>There has been slight progress towards
reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations
conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement,
INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said.
    "There has been some slight progress but it is not the end
of the road yet," he said.
    The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last
effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which
expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries
are taking part in the twoweek meeting.
    Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by
tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings.
    At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting
in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle
those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be
done next week.
    Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that
producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible
downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by
consumers under certain circumstances.
    The sources said this means that any possible adjustment
would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" or "may
sell" and "must buy" or "must sell" levels without changing the
"lower indicative price" or floor price of 150
Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact.
    The present fiveday average of the indicator price is
around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents.
    Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,
set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
kilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.
    Consumers want price reviews at 12month intervals instead
of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to
respond automatically to market trends.
    At present, if the market price has been above or below the
reference price for six months, the reference price is revised
by five pct or by an amount decided by the International
Natural Rubber Organisation council.
    Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment
be automatic at five pct or more.
    Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in
the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that
changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.

<TITLE>"BRITANNIA" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The new British one ounce gold coin, the
"Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the
day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officials
said.
    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members
of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign
coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold
Market and all exports of the coins will be zerorated. No
decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.
    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian
Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the
place of the South African krugerrand, the British government
still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one
ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at
present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.
    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used
in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be
bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be
difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.
    No details are yet available on how many coins will be
issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that
the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.
    There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coin
dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor
in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put
off many investors, traders said.
    Some said that the "Britannia" had come too late, with the
Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins
already well established.

<TITLE>LME CONSIDERING CHANGES TO CLEARING SYSTEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal the London Metal Exchange,
LME, change its new clearing system, due to start May 29, was
made today at a meeting of LME members and International
Commodities Clearing House, ICCH, representatives.
    Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, proposed that a daily
cashcleared system common to all other markets should be
adopted, rather than the system currently planned whereby
prompt dates are settled when they mature.
    AMT claims the margin requirements for the latter will be
costly.
    Opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade and
industry representatives who, as traditional users of the
Exchanges hedging facilities, said a cashcleared system would
be more costly for them.
    LME Board Chairman Jacques Lion said any major alterations
to the planned new clearing system would have to be referred to
the Securities and Investment Board, SIB, and this could be
time consuming, bearing in mind the May 29 startup.
    There was also a risk of the Exchange losing its greatest
asset, its trade hedging business, he said.
    Lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the ICCH
continue as planned, details of AMTs cash clearing system be
circulated for consideration and discussion by LME Board,
Committee and members for possible introduction at a later
date.
    The LME also said that Japanese yen contracts will now be
excluded from clearing as they are not used widely enough to
warrant inclusion.

<TITLE>FARM CREDIT LOSS PUT AT 900 MLN FIRST HALF 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A member of the board which
regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm
lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,
hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.
    Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm
credit issues, Farm Credit Administration FCA board member
Jim Billington said "My recommendation is that legislation
aiding the system must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or
it will be difficult to close the farm credit system books."
    Billingtons loss prediction is gloomier than either the
system or its regulator had previously admitted.
    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of
1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in
1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.
    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of
400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of
more than 1.6 billion.
    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs
in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.
    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its
member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically
could be used as capital.
    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion
dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded
in value because of the mounting losses.
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that
Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by
Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall.
    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,
DTenn. said today "the time has arrived to consider
assistance to save the system."
    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that
it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.
    FCA board members differed on whether a direct government
infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system. FCA
chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stock
and system bonds held by investors might avoid the need to
provide "hard capital" to the system.
    However, Billington said "its not really that simple, in my
opinion," adding that government funds may be needed to rescue
the system.
    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

<TITLE>MONTEDISON, OTHER REFINERIES TO SHUT FOR WORK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JO WINTERBOTTOM, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>SelmSocieta Energia Montedison is to
close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March
28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.
    Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at
140150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
    Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently
shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some
months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have
been rearranged to avoid running negativenetback crude.
     Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the 
shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets
bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.
    Garrones refinery at San Quirico capacity 130,000 bpd is
due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the
jointlyowned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity
220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 2025th following
its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman
said.
    The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will
not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.
    In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de
BPs Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since
March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is
181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct
capacity, a company spokesman said.
    Shell Francaises Berre lEtang refinery will shut down in
early April until midJune, a company spokesman said. Capacity
is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage CFR
will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early
April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a
company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.
    Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,
traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more
attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished
in two to three weeks.
    As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the
situation may ease by midApril.

<TITLE>W.R. GRACE ltGRA> DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poors Corp said it
affirmed the ratings on W.R. Grace and Cos 575 mln dlrs of
debt following its fourthquarter 1986 loss of 560 mln dlrs.
    Affirmed were the companys BBBminus senior debt, BBplus
subordinated debt and A3 commercial paper.
    S and P pointed out that the fourthquarter loss resulted
from the writeoff of nearly 600 mln dlrs in assets, especially
in agricultural chemicals and natural resources.
    Because that writeoff had no effect on Graces cash, S and
P affirmed the current ratings, noting that Grace intends to
sell its agricultural business.
    Proceeds from the sale of the agricultural segment could be
used to reduce Graces debt, Standard and Poors said.
    However, S and P said it is less clear whether Grace can
also extricate itself from the project debt from its phosphate
mining joint venture at Four Corners.
    Despite todays rating affirmation, S and P cautioned that
Grace has greaterthanusual vulnerability to rating change in
the next year or two.
    "Uncertainty abounds as to the firms future ownership,
management and direction," the rating agency said.

<TITLE>ATTACKS AFFECT COLOMBIAS OIL OUTLOOKECOPETROL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Continuous rebel raids against oil
pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombias
present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the staterun
oil company Ecopetrol said.
    "It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,"
he told reporters.
    He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister
Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister
Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light
of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the
oilrich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.
    Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos
Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the
armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.
    Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they
would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most
recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage,
the overall situation had improved compared with last December
when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.
    Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon
oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels
of crude.

pct voting control, S and P noted. Trump said he would not
tender for the 5.7 mln shares of publicly held class A stock.
    The agreement is subject to approval by the New Jersey
Casino Control Commission. S and P pointed out that Resorts
aggressive debt leverage is offset by the firms extensive real
estate holdings in Atlantic City, N.J.
    Affirmed were the Bminus subordinated debt of Resorts
International and its financing unit.
    Standard and Poors noted that Resorts International
remains highly leveraged, with significant nearterm financing
requirements for the completion of its new casino/hotel in
Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal.
    While operations are profitable, the interest burden of
debt, along with unusual charges, net of gains, led to a 30.6
mln dlr net loss in 1986, S and P pointed out.
    Longerterm, Resorts is expected to benefit from a
strengthened competitive position, S and P added.

<TITLE>PERUS CENTROMIN SAYS NO COPPER FORCE MAJEURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Perus biggest state mining firm,
Centromin SA, said today there was no immediate force majeure
possibility on its copper shipments after guerrillas blew up a
railway line, interrupting train traffic from the Cobriza
copper mine to the Pacific coast.
    A Centromin spokesman said the managers of the mine at
Cobriza could always ship the the mineral by road to the coast
for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza
produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper
last year.
    Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic
two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a
train laden with minerals 225 km 135 miles east of Lima at
Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.
    An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Perus state
minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no
declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.
    Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters
in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when
train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.
    But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central
Andean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be
restored by Saturday.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he would not object to the sale of computers to Iran
because the technology was that of U.S.designed personal
computers developed ten years ago.
    "We have no reason not to ship it," Baldrige told reporters
after a Senate Banking Committee hearing on export controls.
    Baldrige said the Defense Departments objection that the
computers would be used in newspaper production was not a
reason to bar the granting of an export license. "This is not a
reason for denying it on foreign policy grounds," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM CREDIT LOSS PUT AT 900 MLN IN 1ST HALF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A member of the board which
regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm
lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,
hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.
    Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm
credit issues, Farm Credit Administration FCA board member
Jim Billington said "My recommendation is that legislation
aiding the system must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or
it will be difficult to close the farm credit system books."
    Billingtons loss prediction is gloomier than either the
system or its regulator had previously admitted.
    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of
1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in
1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.
    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of
400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of
more than 1.6 billion.
    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs
in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.
    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its
member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically
could be used as capital.
    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion
dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded
in value because of the mounting losses.
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that
Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by
Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall.
    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,
DTenn. said today "the time has arrived to consider
assistance to save the system."
    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that
it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.
    FCA board members differed on whether a direct government
infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system.
    FCA chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both
borrower stock and system bonds held by investors might avoid
the need to provide "hard capital" to the system.
    However, Billington said "its not really that simple, in my
opinion," adding that government funds may be needed to rescue
the system.
    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

<TITLE>MACMILLAN BLOEDEL ltMMBLF> STOCK UP SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>MacMillan Bloedel
Ltds share price rose 41/2 dlrs to 791/4 after climbing by
as much as 51/4 dlrs in trading earlier on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
    Company officials were not immediately available to comment
on the steep gain.
    Forestry analyst Rick Sales at Vancouver, British
Columbiabased Odlum Brown Ltd said the strength partly
reflected the buoyant forest products industry, the companys
proposed threeforone stock split and strong 1987 earnings
prospects.
    He predicted MacMillan Bloedel would earn eight dlrs a
share this year. The companys 1986 net profit after a 1.45 dlr
extraordinary gain rose to 4.66 dlrs a share from 54 cts a
share in 1985 due to lower costs and stronger markets.
    Sales added that investors might also be expecting "a major
dividend increase." The company paid 75 cts a share in regular
common stock dividends last year.
    MacMillan Bloedels 49 pctowner ltNoranda Inc> "needs cash
and they do have people on MacMillans board of directors,"
said Sales.
    Noranda said earlier this week it planned a public share
offer in its Noranda Forest Inc unit, which holds Norandas
stake in MacMillan Bloedel.
    Sales discounted previous speculation that Noranda might
try to sell its stake in MacMillan.
    Noranda would rather probably like to raise its stake,
Sales said, although he added such a move could meet opposition
from the British Columbia government, which limited
Torontobased Noranda to a minority stake in its 1981 takeover
bid for MacMillan Bloedel.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS SAY U.S. SUBSIDISES MORE THAN EC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The United States subsidises its
agricultural industry much more than the European Community,
according to an internal USDA report, Marcel Cazale, President
of the French Maize Producers Association AGPM, said.
    He told reporters that according to what he described as a
"confidential" report prepared by the USDA which he had seen, the
US took the leading place regarding agricultural subsidies,
ahead of the EC.
    Cazale said according to the report, Argentina and
Australia were the only countries not to subsidise their
agriculture at all, or only by a small amount.
    Cazale said in Argentina subsidies were granted for
exports, but for a very small amount, while in Australia
subsidies were also only for exports, amounting to 15 to 30
pct.
    But Cazale said Australian agriculture received disguised
aid to the extent that fuel and fertilisers benefited from tax
reductions, and transport, electricity and telephones in the
sector had special tariffs. He did not elaborate.

<TITLE>U.K. GOVERNMENT ISSUES INSIDER DEALING SUMMONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Department of Trade and Industry,
DTI, has issued insider dealing charges against a former
employee of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc ltBCOM.L>,
a DTI statement said.
    DTI is charging Ronald Richard Jenkins, until recently
employed by British and Commonwealths subsidiary Cayzer Irvine
and Co Ltd. He is to appear April 27 in a London court.
    The summons is the second insider dealing prosecution
launched by the government under recent legislation.
    The charges allege two insider dealing offences in
securities of B and C and ltSteel Brothers Holdings Plc>.
    A DTI spokesman said plans to prosecute follow a probe into
the matter since midDecember by a lawyer and a London Stock
Exchange official who were officially appointed by the DTI as
inspectors.
    In November, B and C said an unnamed employee had resigned
after he was discovered buying shares in Steel Brothers just
before B and C announced an agreed bid for the 55 pct of Steel
which it did not already own.
    The attempted trade, which was subsequently cancelled,
covered 2,500 Steel shares purchase at 595p compared with a bid
price at 630p.

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin
said he has asked the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry
lobby group, for an explanation of the level of credit card
interest rates.
    Hockin said he hopes to here the associations response on
the "important" issue soon. Hockin was responding to questions
in the House of Commons about why credit card rates, which run
as high as 28 pct per year, remain high when other rates are
falling.
    Today, the Canadian bank rate fell to 7.28 pct from 7.54
pct last week and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce cut
its prime rate, effective tomorrow, to 8.75 pct from 9.25 pct.

<TITLE>PAINEWEBBER ltPWJ> BROKER INDICTED IN SCHEME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A former broker at PaineWebber Inc was
charged by a federal grand jury with involvement in a 700,000
dlr moneylaundering scheme, according to indictment papers.
    Gary Eder, 41, a former vicepresident at PaineWebber, was
charged with conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records in the
twocount indictment.
    According to the indictment, Eder produced more brokerage
commissions than any other broker at PaineWebber, and was its
most highlypaid broker between 198286.
    Eder is charged with conspiring with unnamed supervisors at
PaineWebber to prevent the filing of Currency Transaction
Reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Federal law requires
that reports be filed with the IRS for any single cash
transaction in one day of more than 10,000 dlrs.
    Asked about the charges, a Painewebber spokeswoman said the
company had not seen the indictment and had no comment. She
said Eder was suspended January 22 and resigned from the firm
on february 17.
    David Spears, the federal prosecutor in charge of the case,
said Eder received cash from individual customers in amounts
ranging up to 70,000 dlrs at a time but avoided filing reports
by depositing the cash into the customers accounts in amounts
just under 10,000 dlrs on several different days.
    If convicted, Eder could receive a maximum jail term of ten
years and 260,000 dlrs in fines.

an amendment to their complaint to include a class action
count.
    Alleghney said the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court

the sale of Alleghney to an affiliate of First Boston Inc.
    Allegheney said the additional count sought by the

the proposed sale is to absolve the individual defendants of
liability in the lawsuit.
     The additional count among other forms of relief, requests
an injunction against the defendants from taking any steps to

<TITLE>PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Pessimism over the effects of a
prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is
rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln
bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.
    Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of
Salvador that despite scattered rains since midFebruary, which
broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as
hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the
first three months of the May/September crop.
    The sources said arrivals from May through July might only
reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of
1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.
    Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods
from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted
a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which
flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more
likely from late July on.
    This years crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices
mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and
insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.
    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over
500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.
    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,
estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely
vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0
mln bag mark if the disease hits.
    Although flowering was good following the start of the
rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because
the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which
pollinates flowers, the sources said.
    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are
now generally back to near normal levels and that current
flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in
mature fruit from August through September.
    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of
beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the
main crop, which officially starts on October 1.
    "The cutoff date is completely artificial. If things go
well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break
from August through November or even December," one said.
    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove
accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the
past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when
prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln
bags, the lowest since 1974.
    Good growing conditions the following year produced a
temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag
record, while last years output, which also suffered some
drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.
    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards
by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.
    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to
have been undeclared from this years record total harvest and
they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the
end of the official crop year on April 30.
    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the
inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port
warehouses but not declared.
    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,
significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored
too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected
to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.
    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and
main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks
still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be
at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,
the sources said.
    This would compare with the previous record set last year
of 6.03 mln.
    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop
beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao
and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be
officially registered.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP ltPCC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Purolator Courier corps stock rose on
specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlrashare, 265
mlndlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
its Purolator courier divisions management.
    The stock today hit 361/4, up one.
    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
division.
    "Basically, the courier division is a company that has
450 mln dlrs in revenues. Its a very large company and its
being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephone
interview with Reuters.
    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
personally owns 20,000 shares.
    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
letter from Gardner.
    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
speculated another courier company would be the most likely
suitor.
    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
the stock into play again.
    "Theres no shortage of possibilities. Its just a question
of managements willingness to let the process continue," said
one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
cash per share. The balance of Purolators stock will be bought
for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
courier operations.
    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
Purolator.
    "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
deal thats on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
someone else in the world that could do it higher," said one
arbitrager.
    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
risk to the firm.
    "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," said
one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
employees.
    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
in socalled "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge
financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
be a substantial expense to the firm.
    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
said fees are at the low end of the scale.
    "Its a very complex transaction, but basically what
happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"
Gardner said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department said
private U.S. exporters reported purchases from foreign sellers
of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery to unknown
destinations.
    The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter
and 60,000 tones of soft red winter, is for delivery during the
1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which
a U.S. exporter contracts to buy U.S.produced commodities from
a foreign firm, the department said.

<TITLE>WEINBERGER OPPOSES FUJITSU BUYING U.S. FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
will join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fighting
Fujitsu Ltds ltITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of ltFairchild
Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
    "He Weinberger opposes it. It is not in the best interests
of the country to have more of the microelectronics business
leaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, who
asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
    Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that
Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House
Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
    Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger
feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on
foreign electronic support.
    But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger
and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer
equipment to Iran.
    The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that
defense objections to two proposed sales  to an Iranian power
company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency  were
not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go
through unless more evidence was presented.

<TITLE>GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Implementation of a oneyear 0/92
pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
another option when making their planting decisions.
    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, DKans.,
chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
grains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."
    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
said that it will probably be introduced next week.
    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill 
only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
the current bill.
    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
    Decoupling  delinking planting decisions from government
payments  is too much of a policy change to approve at this
point, he said.
    "I dont think there is any interest in pursuing a
decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman said
at the hearing.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz RMinn., cosponsor of the
Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
we can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.
    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers
dependency on the government, he said.
    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
the National Cattlemens Association said their groups oppose
any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
    But when asked if his association were forced to choose
between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

<TITLE>MILLER SAYS NO U.S. TAX HIKES TO CUT DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     DALLAS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Director of the Office of Management
and Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had no
intention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federal
budget deficit.
     "There will be no tax increases," he said three times
before a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern Methodist
Universitys Edwin L. Cox School of Business.
     The budget deficit, which is currently slated at 173
billion dlrs for fiscal 1988, is supposed to be reduced to 108
billion dlrs under the provisions of the GrammRudman Act,
which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991.
     Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reduced
but added, "the surest way to put us in a pickle" would be to
raise or ease the GrammRudman goal.
     "If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform, it
would create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets," he
said, adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficit
would also create uncertainty.
     Miller reiterated the presidents budget proposal that the
deficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs through
increased revenues and spending cuts. An additional 23 billion
dlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budget
deficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target.
     Miller said it was possible the Administration might
support an oil import fee, but added that the President was
concerned that such a move might have more adverse results than
benefits.
     He also said the Administration was seeking to spin off
Amtrak, which costs the government about 500 mln dlrs a year,
but added that he did not expect it to be accomplished this
year.

<TITLE>FCC PANEL RECOMMENDS PHONE FEE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A Federal Communications Commission
FCC board recommended raising the twodollar monthly
subscriber line charge for residential telephone customers by
1.50 dlrs over the next two years.
    The subscriber line charge was first levied by the FCC in
June, 1985, in an effort to more acurately reflect the cost of
providing phone service as a part of phone deregulation.
    The recommendation by the board, composed of federal and
state utility regulators, was expected to be approved by the
FCC in a seperate decision in the next few weeks.
    The subscriber line charge for residences and businesses
with single phone lines will rise to 2.60 dlrs in June 1987,
3.20 in September 1988, and 3.50 dlrs in April 1989.
    The staff of the FCC said at a public meeting that the
increase in the charge would make possible a reduction in
longdistance phone rates of 15 pct or 17 billion dlrs over six
years.
    Supporters of the subscriber line charge have argued that
long distance phone rates had been subsidizing local phone
service, which would lead to abandonment of the phone network
by large commercial phone customers.

    The rating agency cited Alleghenys high leverage and poor
operating performance, as well as reduced cash flow.
    Moodys said the companys prospects for improvement are
limited by increasing competition in the food service industry
and decreasing demand for the vending services that Allegheny
provides. Moodys also said a renegotiated bank agreement
includes accelerated amortization requirements that exacerbate
Alleghenys already weakened ability to service its debt.

    Iowa Beef closed the proessing plant indefinitely in

    The legislation would require Congress to approve all
subsidies on loans, to sell off many loans to the private
sector shortly after they are made and to buy private
reinsurance for many guaranteed loans.
    White House officials estimated reinsurance premiums  could
amount to six billion dlrs a year to private companies.
    The bill would make little impact on the federal deficit or
payroll, officials said.
    The legislation would not in itself alter the terms of
federal credit programs.
    But officials said they would be pleased if Congress
tightened some programs after seeing their true cost set out in
the budget.
    The program would call for the immediate sale of many newly
made direct federal loans, but would no effect existing federal
loan portfolios. Some of these are already proposed to be sold
off under previous administration programs.
    Exempt from the sale requirement would be loans made under
the Commodity Credit Corp commodity loan program, which the
government considers to be a commodity purchase program rather
than a credit program, and defaulted guaranteed loans, which
the government considers to be the same as direct loans.
    Also excluded from the sale requirement would be most
foreign loans, though officials said they may at some point
consider selling off some ExportImport Bank loans.
    Officials said government loan programs currently amount to
about 252 billion dlrs in direct loans and 450 billion dlrs in
guaranteed loans a year.
    Officials said U.S. agencies were asked to calculate the
approximate cost of their loan subsidies by looking at
comparable loans in the marketplace.
    The administration is asking Congress to begin reflecting
the cost of these subsidies in the fiscal 1988 budget, which
the House Budget Committee plans to begin marking up late next
week.
    Officials said the reforms, if adopted acrosstheboard by
all affected congressional committees, would lower the federal
deficit by only 100 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988.
    Officials said the administration hopes to sell a total of
13.0 billion dlrs in loan assets during fiscal 1988, including
1.8 billion dlrs in loan assets under the credit reform program
and 11.2 billion dlrs in loan assets already in the
governemnts portfolion.
    In fiscal 1989, the administration hopes to sell 8.9
billion dlrs in loans, including 1.3 billion dlrs of loans
under the credit reform program and 7.6 billion dlrs from the
existing portfolio.

<TITLE>NO CLEAR EVIDENCE TRADE GAP REVERSED  VOLCKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the
deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.
    "The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence
that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been
reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
luncheon for community leaders here.
    However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,
particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,
achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.
    Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic
perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the
investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to
service the debt.
    He said the process of restoring external balance to the
U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said
needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of
financial and real resources into internationally competitive
industry. "More of our growth will need to be reflected in net
exports and business investment and less in consumption,"
Volcker said.

lockout at its Dakota City, Nebraska, processing plant and
plans to resume operations March 16, United Food and Commercial
Workers UFCW Union spokesman Allen Zack said.
    Iowa Beef mailed a letter to members of UFCW Local 222
informing them a lockout imposed by the company December 14
would be lifted and meatpackers could return to work under Iowa
Beefs "revised, last and best final offer," Zack said.
    Iowa Beef had closed the plant indefinitely in midDecember
because it said it had no alternative to threats by meatpackers
to disrupt operations.
    About 2,800 members of Local 222 are affected by the
shutdown. A 31/2 year labor contract at the plant expired
December 13.

<TITLE>ALLIEDLYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>AlliedLyons PLC ltALLD.L> and Canadas
Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
distiller Hiram WalkerGooderham and Worts, AlliedLyons
chairman Derrick HoldenBrown said.
    AlliedLyons got 51 pct control of Hiram WalkerGooderham
last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns
ltGulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an outofcourt pact
after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
ltHiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
there wont be any change, but there could be," HoldenBrown
told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
    He said AlliedLyons has a twoyear call option that could
force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to AlliedLyons, and
Gulf Canada has a twoyear put option that could obligate
AlliedLyons to buy its 49 pct.
    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
for either the put or call to be exercised," HoldenBrown said.
    In answer to a reporters question, HoldenBrown said it
would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
pct in a public offering with AlliedLyons consent. "I dont
think we would have any objection to it," he added.
    AlliedLyons maintains control of Hiram WalkerGooderhams
board of directors and has total responsibility for its
management. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," he
said.
    HoldenBrown would not disclose how big a profit
contribution the distiller will make in AlliedLyons financial
results, but he said "it will be substantial."
    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.
    HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons was able to finance the
Hiram WalkerGooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
and has no current plans for a stock issue.
    He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
concerns. "I dont think we shall be looking at the brewery
scene which is highly concentrated already," he added.
    HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons plans to list its shares on
Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

<TITLE>FARM CREDIT STABILIZES FURTHER IN PLAINS STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Farm credit conditions showed
further signs of stabilizing in the plains and mountain states
during the fourth quarter of 1986, according to bankers
surveyed by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.
    The rate of loan repayment improved as one of every four
bankers reported higher loan repayment rates than a year ago.
Respondents said interest rates continued to edge lower.
    However, the decline in farm real estate values quickened
after moderating through the year, dropping an average four
pct. Farmland values averaged 14 pct lower than a year earlier
and 55 pct below 1981s peak values.
    The survey authors blamed the drop on depressed crop prices
and uncertainty about the future of government crop programs.
    Farm loan demand was the lowest since 1986 with only 13 pct
of the survey respondents reporting an increase in loan demand.
The also reported that 25 pct of the nonfarm businesses in
their areas were having severe financial problems, and said the
rate of rural nonfarm business closings was nearly three times
higher than normal.
    Over 150 bankers responded to the survey in the Tenth
Federal Reserve District which includes all or parts of
Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Wyoming.

<TITLE>CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The use of generic inkind commodity
certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a
necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive
for the worlds largest grain company said.
    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president
of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies
have made huge profits from certificate trading.
    "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the
trade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing
with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that
this is within the normal grain marketing levels.
    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of
certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to
look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for
example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll
marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.
    Certificates are also an important part of any export
promotion program, he said.
    "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the
more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain
into the market to meet demand," he said.
    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman DKans. said his
committee would be looking at the certificate program later
this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on
certificate costs.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed a
proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil
imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption.
    Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a
fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports
peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and
this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said. 
    The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would
would require the president to issue annual threeyear oil
import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he
would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.

<TITLE>VIACOM ltVIA> FACES "COSBY SHOW" SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>ltCaseyWerner Co>, producer of "The
Cosby Show," said it filed suit against Viacom International
Inc, seeking assurances that it will receive its share of
revenues from the shows syndication.
    It said the debt burden placed on Viacom by the 3.4 billion
dlr buyout proposal from ltNational Amusements Inc> and Viacoms
9.9 mln dlr 1986 loss may prevent it from paying CaseyWerner
its money due from the show.
    CaseyWerner sought assurances from Viacom that its share
of the syndication will not go to Viacoms creditors. But it
said Viacom declined to provide the assurance.
    Alvin Schulman, an attorney representing CaseyWerner, said
Viacom should receive about 450 mln dlrs total from the
syndication rights to the show. CaseyWerner is entitled to
about 66 pct of the funds, he said.
    Schulman added that Viacom is due to receive in March and
April an initial 40 mln dlrs from the syndication rights. To
ensure CaseyWerner receives its share, the company filed suit,
he said.
    The suit asked the court to place all funds due
CaseyWerner in a trust, and for Viacom to account for all
funds received.

<TITLE>KENYAN LEADER APPEALS FOR U.S. INVESTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan today had talks
with Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, who afterwards appealed
for more U.S. investment in Kenya and a deeper American
commitment to ending apartheid in South Africa.
    A senior administration official said that during the talks
Reagan stressed to Moi the importance of Kenyas maintaining
its high standards on human rights.
    The official said South Africa had not been a contentious
issue in the talks and that the two leaders had found a lot of
common ground on the issue. 
    The administration has practiced a policy of "constructive
engagement" with South Africa and accepted trade sanctions only
after they had been imposed by Congress.

<TITLE>DOME ltDMP> SAYS MOST LENDERS SUPPORT DEBT PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd said a
majority of a group of 56 major creditors support the companys
revised proposal to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion
Canadian dlrs.
    Outlining terms of the plan circulated to the lenders
earlier this week, the company said it is seeking approval in
principle for the proposal "within the next several weeks" in
order to implement the debt rescheduling by June 30, 1987.
    "Although at todays price levels it only allows the company
to struggle on, benefits appear as oil prices rise," Dome
chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
    "We believe the plan is a rational one, and will be valid
under a range of circumstances," chairman Macdonald said.
    The lenders previously agreed to an interim debt
rescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate a
longterm recapitalization.
    The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence
of the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery of
their loans, Dome said.
    The plan would maintain debt levels within Domes ability
to pay, subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender.
    Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity
conversion options and reclassification to lower interest
bearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives.
    Under certain circumstances, lenders will have the option
to convert all or part of their debt to common shares at a
predetermined conversion rate upon plan implementation.
    The various conversion rates remain to be set through
negotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predict
the extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and
the amount of dilution that may result.
    Converting debt to common shares after the plan is
implemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Dome
said.
    Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan
before it is put in place.
    Debt that remains after share conversion will either
receive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates and
a 15 to 20 year payout, or interest rates indexed to oil
prices. The company will use both an annual securitytodebt
ratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify which
interest payments are paid on the different portions of debt.
    To achieve a stable operating base for the company, the
plan provides for deducting operating costs, capital
expenditures and general and administrative expenses before the
remaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Dome
said.
    The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate
the business as efficiently as possible, it said.
    As the company previously said, debt payments from cash
flow be divided into two broad categories, secured and
unsecured creditors.
    Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional
unsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold private
debt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets. This
portion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15year
repayment schedule.
    Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paid
through convertible, oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in
20 years, or any available excess cash flow, or conversion to
equity. Any institutional lender also has the option of taking
all or part of its debt in common shares.
    To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome said
they can also convert all or part of their debt to common
shares when the plan is implemented. Any debt leftover would be
exchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate
linked to oil prices.
    Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by
the assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula,
the company said.
    Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted to
oillinked debentures.

agricultural prices, have been heavily affected by worldwide
surpluses.
    Commercial construction, he said, is suffering from earlier
overbuilding in many areas.
    More broadly, he said, there are distortions and imbalances
in the U.S. economy that cut across many sectors.
    "Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly, they will
undermine all that has been achieved," Volcker warned.
    He said one problem is that economic activity over the past
two years has been supported largely by consumption.
    He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expense
of reduced personal savings. At the same time, he said, the
huge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionate
amount of the savings generated in the U.S.
    Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination of
low savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have been
escaped by drawing on capital from abroad.
    He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U.S.
in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U.S. households.
    "That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to which
our financial markets are hostage to possible changes in
external attitudes and circumstances," Volcker said.

<TITLE>BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Iredale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LA PAZ, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Bolivia is to make a formal offer during
the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from
commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank
president Jier Nogales said.
     Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering
committee of Bolivias creditor banks had agreed to consider
the offer at a meeting in New York last month.
     He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian
paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now
trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.
    Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back
its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the
discounted rate in full.
    Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to
30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the
international markets, he added.
    Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans
to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there
would be no money available to restart traditional debt
servicing to them for some time.
     Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to
cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buybacks,
but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a
formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at
discounted rates.
    Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would
determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in
the next few months.
     He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over
the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make
a single nonnegotiable offer.
    He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly
creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only
traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would
mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss
provisions, he added.
    "We are confident that the banks are going to be
reasonable," Nogales said. "Now they can resolve their problems
for once and for all."
    "The most conservative ones who want a little more will
wait a year, but I dont know if the window of opportunity will
be open all the time," he added.
    Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivias four
billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to
governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales
said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent
discussions with the Paris Club.
     He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule
Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while
accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest
rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris
Club rules, he added.
     He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard
penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with
Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.
    He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from
international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400
mln dlrs in disbursements this year.
    The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed
from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow
of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.
    Nogales said that Bolivias net international reserves now
stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in
disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro
took office in August, 1985.
    Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a
year in the governments first month in office, was now down to
10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the
plan was that it should continue at this level.
    He said the government was also expecting at least three
pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative
rates.

<TITLE>U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVEBOSCHWITZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,
feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus
production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz RMinn. said.
    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he told
the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and
feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a
marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused
support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.
    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more
production, especially in highyielding areas, would be much
more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans
and not increase exports significantly, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The House Ways and Means Trade 
Subcommittee unanimously approved a toneddown version of
legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
congressional sources said.
    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
frightening word protectionism," Ways and Means chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
by those countries. 
    The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
    The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
committees.
    It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
U.S. actions against other countries.
    The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
    It extends until January 1993, the administrations
authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on
copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.

<TITLE>INFLATION STILL A CONCERN, VOLCKER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain
concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.
    "A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,
both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said in
remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders
here.
    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary
pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the
exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.
    He said participants in financial markets and business
remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.
    "Should the skepticism about our ability to resist
inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for
interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy
generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that
danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of
monetary policy," the Fed chairman said.
    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would
undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk
dissipating the flow of foreign capital.

<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures posted a robust
rally today after a major beef packing company said it would
end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb.
    April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market
expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant
restarts operations.
    Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum,
said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the
nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14,
the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired.
    The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several
thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said.
    The company said it locked out union workers because they
threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union
meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the companys
latest contract offer March 5.
    Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors
circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further
fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on
cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle.
    The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and
frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications
that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate
than previously expected.
    Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
    But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the
price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday,
said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices
recover from early weakness, traders said.
    Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the
silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver
prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its
customers buy the metal, traders said.
    Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that
Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said.
    Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European
Commission on Wednesday.
    Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture
Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible
land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said.
    Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt
exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just
beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.
    Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to
trends on price charts, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN FUND ltJPN> TO PROPOSE CONVERSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan Fund Inc said its board would
recommend at its April 23 stockholders meeting that the Fund be
converted to a noload openend fund.
    If approved, the Fund said a redemption fee of one pct of
net asset value will be imposed on redemptions for a period of
time not to exceed six months after openending.
    It said such a redemption fee is designed to cover
trasaction costs related to early redemptions and will remain
in the assets of the Fund.
    It said Shearson Lehman Brothers is serving as its
financial advisor.
    In a prepared statement, Jonathan Mason, Japan Funds
chairman, said "openending, which is timely, given the
expansion of the Japanese stock markets, particularly in the
last few years, will eliminate the discount from net asset
value and will afford investors the continuing opportunity for
investment in Japan through the Japan Fund."
    Japan Fund said it proposed the conversion to an openend
fund after rejecting a takeover offer of about 525 mln dlrs
from an investment group led by T. Boone Pickens III, son of
the Texas oilman.
    The investor group, whose other members include ltSterling
Grace Capital Fund LP> and ltAnglo American Security Fund LP>,
could not be reached tonight for comment.
    When it made its takeover offer on March 3, the group said
it owned 1.4 mln shares, or about 4.9 pct, of the funds
outstanding stock.
    Asked to comment on the rejection of the investor groups
offer, a Japan Fund spokeswoman said, "The board decided that
an openend fund was preferable."
    The spokeswoman, Davia B. Temin, said no other comments
would be made on the offer.
    She also declined to provide details on other options Japan
Fund said previously that it would consider along with the
takeover bid.

said that as of December 31, 1986, its estimated proved
reserves totaled 18.5 mln barrels of oil and 52.9 mln MCF, or
thousand cubic feet, of gas.
    This compares with yearend 1985 proved reserves estimates
of 26.4 mln barrels of oil and 78.6 mln MCF of gas, Permian
said.
    Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved
reserves were 335.6 mln dlrs, down from 814.2 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Permian said the present value of estimated future net
revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165.3 mln dlrs, compared with
374.3 mln dlrs.
    It said the downward revisions in both proved reserves and
estimated future net revenues resulted from decreased prices for
oil and gas.

<TITLE>SEC ASKS NYSE TO TIGHTEN TRIPLE WITCHING PROCESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten an
experimental procedure used in the past six months to dampen
volatility linked to the socalled "triplewitching hour."
    The Big Board has been collecting and publicizing
information on large imbalances of "marketonclose" MOC
orders placed on 50 major stocks onehalfhour before closing
on socalled expiration Fridays in September and December.
    Expiration Fridays, or triple witching hours, occur every
three months when stock options, stock index options and
futures on index options expire simultaneously.
    As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options on
previous expiration Fridays, they sold huge amounts of stock
which they had used to offset their positions.
    The huge sell orders, which usually entered the market in
the final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wild
price swings in the 50 stocks which serve as the basis for the
options and futures.
    The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to request
that the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by 1530 hrs
on expiration Fridays, which would then be made public, giving
the market a halfhour to settle order imbalances.
    But in a March 12 letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum,
SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in the
experimental procedure during the Dec 19 expiration Friday.
    A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed until
after 1530 EST on Dec 19, which helped send the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up 21 points in the final minutes of the day
to a 14.20point gain on the day, Ketchum said.
    Citing the SECs concern about such trading, Ketchum asked
the exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting any
preexisting MOC orders after 1530 if they could have been
placed earlier.
    The new restriction, which SEC officials said merely
clarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure,
would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders for
arbitrage purposes after 1530 hrs, even if they offset other
reported order imbalances in those stocks.
    The only MOC orders the SEC will allow to be placed after
1530 EST on March 20, the next expiration Friday, are those
that are received by Big Board member firms after 1530 EST and
which help reduce existing order imbalances, Ketchum said.
    If there are no published imbalances in a particular stock,
no MOC orders will be accepted in that stock, he said.
    "If dissemination of MOC orders is to provide an accurate
indication of true order imbalances, then all existing MOC
orders must be submitted by 330 p.m. and only those new MOC
orders responding to reported imbalances can be permitted,"
Ketchum said.
    The letter did not say how the SEC or the NYSE would
determine the difference between preexisting MOC orders that
would be barred, and new MOC orders that would be allowed to
reduce imbalances. But an SEC official said the agency hopes
the NYSE and its members would adhere to the rules "in a spirit
of cooperation."

<TITLE>VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS REFINANCING ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 12  </DATELINE><BODY>president jaime lusinchi defended the
20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government
recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring
needed foreign investment to venezuela.
    In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also
said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite
having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.
    In the 90minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up
the achievements of his administration, which took office in
february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in nonoil gdp
in 1986 and to a "moderate" 12 pct inflation rate.
    Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed
feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been the calvary of
our nation over the post four years.
    In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to
achieve the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of
financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of
development and the financing of trade and investment.
    Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he
said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported
components of new development projects.
    "our intention is not to continue being net exporters of
capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of
capital towards venezuela," he said.
    Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended
payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest
rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.
    At the same time, payments over the next three years were
lowered from 3.450 to 1.350 billion dlrs.
    Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics
who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future
governments.

<TITLE>BRAZIL NEEDS MORE EXTERNAL FINANCING  VOLCKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said that Brazil will need more external financing to
work its way out of its current debt crisis than earlier
anticipated.
    "External financing will have to be found in larger amounts
than anticipated a few months ago," he said in remarks prepared
for a business leader luncheon.
    Volcker said that financing, however, must take place along
with policies that come to grips with Brazils internal
difficulties.
    Volcker said Brazil has a lot more negotiating to do with
international institutions and its bank creditors but added
that a solution to its financial problems can be found.
    "The predicate for these negotiations has to be effective
policy at home in Brazil," Volcker told reporters.
    "Brazil, it seems to me, has a strong self interest in
restoring a more normal situation on interest payments so
that it can continue to participate freely in trade with the
rest of the world  and it has so indicated," Volcker said in
his prepared remarks.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt last month.

<TITLE>VOLCKER SEES BENEFIT IN FDIC/FSLIC MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker said a combination of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp, FDIC, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp,
FSLIC, could be contemplated in the longer term but is not an
answer to the thrift industrys immediate problems.
    "I dont think its an answer to 1977 or 1988," Volcker
said at a press conference.
    But a merger of the two depositinsurance agencies could be
an option as part of a general structural reform of the U.S.
banking system.
    The aim of a merger would not be for commercial banks to
subsidize ailing savings and loan associations but to improve
official oversight of depository institutions, Volcker said.
    "The attractive element is that you get almost by
definition a consistency of supervision and regulation that you
dont have now," he explained.

<TITLE>FEDERAL REGULATORS CLOSE TWO TEXAS BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
FDIC said two Texas banks were closed by U.S. bank
regulators, making a total of 40 failures of federally insured
financial institutions so far this year.
    Fourteen of the 40 have been in Texas, which has been hard
hit by plummeting oil prices.
    The FDIC said it approved paying off the insured depositors
of the failed Plaza National Bank, Del Rio, Texas.
    The bank, with assets of 34.8 mln dlrs, was closed today by
the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.
    The FDIC said it decided to pay off depositors because no
other institution wanted to buy the failed bank.
    The FDIC said 15 accounts exceeded the federal insurance
limit of 100,000 dlrs by a total of 38,000 dlrs.
    Owners of the uninsured deposits will share with the FDIC
as the failed banks assets are liquidated.
    The FDIC also approved the assumption of deposits of The
First National Bank of Olney, Texas, by Olney Bancshares Inc.,
Olney, Texas.
    The bank had total assets of 15 mln dlrs when it was closed
by federal regulators.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils stateoil company,
Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
conditions after Brazils decision to halt interest payment of
its commercial debts last month.
    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
consumption in Brazil.
    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazils terms by
Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
    "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabias traditional client since
1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said.
    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
from Brazil, he said.
    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
workers and a twoweek stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." 
    Saudi Arabia is Brazils second biggest oil supplier, with
an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I
am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers
from elsewhere," Santana added.

<TITLE>CBOE CREATES NEW CLASS OF S AND P 500 OPTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>In order to accomodate the shift in the
settlement procedure for options on the Standard and Poors 500
stock index that the exchange announced last month, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange CBOE said it has created a new class
of options for the S and P contract ltSPX>.
    The CBOEs new contract was needed to coincide with changes
in the settlement procedure that the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange CME made on its S and P 500 futures and options
contract which will be implemented with the expiration of the
June contract.
    Settlement of the CBOEs new option contract will be based
on the opening price of the S and P 500 index on expiraton day,
while settlement of the current contract is based on the
closing price of the index.
    "CBOE doesnt think that opening settlement is the solution
to the expiration effect, but we cannot exposure investors in
our market to unanticipated risks arising from different
settlement times in options and futures," CBOE chairman Alger
Chapman said in a release.
    "Were taking this step to give investors a choice of
settlement times that meet their hedging needs," Chapman said.
    The new contract was necessary because the Options Clearing
Corp OCC did not allow its member exchanges to modify terms
of any of its outstanding contracts, the CBOE said.
    The new contract will satisfy the needs of customers who
require an options contract based on opening prices of the
index, the CBOE said.
    The opening settlement contract will trade parallel to the
closing settlement contract as long as the CME maintains its
opening settlement procedure for the S and P 500 futures
contract, a CBOE spokesperson said.
    However, she noted that customer preference for one type of
settlement procedure will eventually determine which contract
will prevail.
    The opening settlement contract will trade on a March,
June, September, December quarterly expiration cycle and will
be listed as soon as the OCC revises its contract prospectus,
possible in April, the exchange said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee unanimously approved a toneddown version of
legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
congressional sources said.
    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
frightening word protectionism," Ways and Means chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut
by those countries.

committee is too restrictive regarding the Federal Reserve.
    "I dont think our hands should be tied so much as in that

    The bill would set a oneyear moratorium on approval of
certain powers that banks have already applied to the Federal

<TITLE>FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank reserve, monetary and
discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve
today clearly indicate that policy is "on hold" and may not be
changed for weeks or even months, economists said.
    "The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not
about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs
on the economy," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.
    "These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in
prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for
policy change," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.
    Fed data released today were all in line with economists
expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.
    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two
weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln
dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed
from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.
    It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two
weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.
    Finally, the Fed said that the M1 money supply fell 800
mln dlrs in February, with the broader M2 measure down 1.6
billion dlrs and M3 up an even three billion dlrs.
    Analysts said that M1 last month grew at a negative 1.3
pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M2 and actual
positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M3.
    February levels of M2 and M3 left the aggregates 18.2 and
20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits
set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is
51/2 to 81/2 pct. There is no M1 target.
    "In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the
Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money
growth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government
Securities Inc.
    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary
growth in March after Februarys anemic growth rates. However,
they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to
prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the
economy shows evidence of weakness.
    Commenting on Februarys decline in the key M2 aggregate,
Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money
market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four
billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so Februarys
weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M2
and M3 growth rates of 31/2 to four pct during March.
    Griggs said that M2 and M3 in coming months should return
to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so
continue to present no problem for the Fed.
    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with
its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps
several more months of economic data before deciding whether or
not to ease its grip on reserves.
    Given the economys fragility in many sectors, the analysts
agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose
to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next
changes policy.
    "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as
low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six
pct," said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct
in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.
    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on
Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added
reserves directly through twoday System repurchases.
    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate
be largely marketdriven. They said it is focusing instead on a
borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>COLOMBIAS COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia intends to improve the
marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on
setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar
Gaviria said.
    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export
registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb exdock
New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.
    "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the
reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that
will allow private exporters to participate more actively in
Colombias coffee export policy," he said.
    Traders said this means the export registration price will
change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.
    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market
factors since a return to a system of International Coffee
Organisation ICO export quotas may not occur in the short
term.
    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock
over reintroduction of export quotas, suspended in February
1986.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer
from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices
with increased volume.
    "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of
coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags of 60 kilos, and will do
so without an agreement among producers," he said.
    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5
mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea is
precisely not to disrupt the market."
    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86
coffee year which ended last September 30.
    Echoing Gavirias words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the
national coffee growers federation, said Colombia sought to
adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.
    "There is great expectation in the world for the policies
that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to
emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the
immediate future," he told journalists.
    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazils future export
policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.
    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when
problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks
have been resolved.
    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying
Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to
suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the
Brazilian stand was quite clear.
    He said Brazils current quota "reflects the reality of the
market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," but
added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that
determined it.
    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure
of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among
dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers
would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,
which did not happen.

<TITLE>INVESTORS MORE ACTIVE IN GILT MARKET, SURVEY SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Institutional investors are finding it
difficult to find "the best price" for transactions in U.K.
Government bonds gilts and have become more active in the
market since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in
October, agency broker CapelCure Myers said in a survey.
    The survey, covering a broad section of institutional
investors, also showed that investors were uneasy about the
impartiality of market makers advice. Given their concerns,
over half those surveyed said they spend more time managing
their portfolios. At the same time, the investors believed the
market was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang.
    CapelCure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70
institutions which are not clients of that firm.
    Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total,
building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct,
insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct.
    The survey found that with the virtual elimination of
commissions, the improved market liquidity has encouraged
investors to deal more frequently in the market. Of those
responding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25
pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively.
    A CapelCure official told reporters the elimination of
commissions has made the market more competitive.
    He said CapelCure has deliberately set low commisstions
because of this.
    Nearly half the respondents said they now have their own
dealing team to cope with the new market, although the
definition of a "dealing team" was ambiguous, the survey said.
    Rather than being a selfcontained, specialised group of
dealers who spend all their time searching for prices, the
definition now appears to be the less formal idea of a
multipurpose fund manager, it said.
    The survey supported the general view in the gilt market
that a shakeout of the 27 marketmakers is likely.
    It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed that
the total number of market makers in three years time would be
less than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be less
than 15.
    Some 79 pct of respondents said they expect the number of
agency brokers for which there was no estimate to fall over
the next three years. Unlike broker/dealers, agency brokers do
not take positions in the market, but the survey showed 68 pct
of respondents did not consider this very important when
deciding whether to use one.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000
barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help
it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
visit here this week by Ecuadors Deputy Energy Minister
Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
offsetting the loss of Ecuadors 140,000 in exports caused by
earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
was put out of action.
    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuadors
is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this
weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.
    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by
Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.
    "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this
country would have ground to a halt," he said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Debt talks between the Philippine
government and its bank advisory committee were delicately
poised after a brief meeting between the two sides today,
bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said.
    "We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress," a
banker said. "The banks are anxious to come to an agreement."
    But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talks
would end successfully. Caution was also evident in the
Philippine camp. "We feel the balls in the banks court," one
source said. The two sides will meet again on Friday.
    The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to
reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated
by a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance
minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the countrys interest
bill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.
    Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in
cash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.
    The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,
but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought
to satisfy the banks objections by guaranteeing that the notes
would yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.    
    The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the
new proposal.
    Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm
support for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope
that the banks would embrace the idea.
    But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing
possible accounting consequences as well as considering the
precedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.
    One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.
lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to
worry about.
    "To the extent that its a precedent, its a precedent to
be encouraged," Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen and Hamilton, told a debtequity swaps conference
sponsored by Euromoney magazine.
    Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollardenominated
PINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert
them into pesos at face value to fund governmentapproved
equity investments in the Philippines.
    In effect, international firms would be paying part of
Manilas interest bill, allowing the government to conserve
muchneeded hard currency.
    One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,
is that it widens the scope of thirdworld debt negotiations,
which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past
41/2 years.
    "Theres another pool of cash at the table now," he said.
    David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,
told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be
part of a "menu" of options available to banks instead of pure
newmoney packages.
    He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexicos 7.7 billion
dlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.
    "We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising
new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank
syndications," Mulford said.
    In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he
said that dissatisfaction with Mexicos economic program and
criticism of communication and coordination within the bank
syndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to
participate in the loan.
    This refusal "for a time appeared to jeopardize the
prospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,"
Mulford said.
    The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,
but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new
life into the financing process, especially with crucial
negotiations with Brazil, about to start.
    The banks for their part insist that they are more than
willing to discuss Mulfords "menu", and say it is the debtors
that need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing
talks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires
dislikes the debtequity schemes and onlending provisions that
the banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready to
endorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance.

most of Brazils 40,000 seamen were still on strike.
    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had

Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.
    The twoweek strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and

<TITLE>ADSTEAM RIGHTS ISSUE TO RAISE 228 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd ltADSA.S>
Adsteam said its oneforfive rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a
share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and
investment, both in Australia and overseas.
    The group announced the issue with its first half earnings
and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed
by a oneforfour bonus issue.
    Adsteams equityaccounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln
dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year
earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.
    Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60
and yesterdays close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.
    The issue will be underwritten by ltMorgan Grenfell
Australia Ltd> and ltMcCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares
to be taken up by Adsteams associate and largest shareholder,
department store retailer ltDavid Jones Ltd>.
    New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will
rank equally thereafter.
    Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate
of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both
issues from 99.36 mln.
    Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally
performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company
and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.
    David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest
associates net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln
a year earlier, Adsteams figures show.
    Whollyowned and joint venture companies also did well
apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which
returned belowbudget profits due to the housing downturn.
    Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction
and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue.

Chronicle from Houston Endowment Inc for 400 mln dlrs.
    The announcement was made jointly by Frank Bennack Jr,

    The Houston Endowment is selling the paper to comply with

    The Chronicle has a daily circulation of over 425,000 and
is in competition with the Houston Post, owned by the ltToronto

    The acquisition gives Hearst its biggest newspaper holding

<TITLE>U.S. DETAILS ITS ACTION PROGRAM FOR AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Has given further details
of an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping
subSaharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems,
senior U.S. Offficials said.
    Under the new program, a 500mln dlr Development Fund for
Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money
going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral
accounts currently in existence.
    Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for Africa,
said he believed Congress will favour the program, which stems
from a U.N. Conference on Africas economic problems.
    The 500mln dlr fund, coupled with an additional 100 mln
dlrs in food aid, would surpass Congress 1986 vote of 483 mln
dlrs for equivalent programs, officials said.
    Washington is also increasing its funding to the
International Development Agency IDA, the World Banks soft
loan affiliate, and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund
for Africa, they said.
    Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got
37 pct of 8.7 billion dlrs, but the Reagan administration wants
this increased to 4550 pct of 12.8 billion dlrs in new funds.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administrations opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a lineitem veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. Weve had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like theyre on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the longrun
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflationinduced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Offices Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options for reducing the budget deficit
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nations history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the GrammRudmanHollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because theres no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by onetime measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

<TITLE>ADSTEAM LOOKING TO BRITISH MARKET FOR INVESTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Diversified industrial and investment
group The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd ltADSA.S> said it was
looking to the British market for future investment in view of
high share prices and interest rates in Australia.
    "Because of lower interest rates and improved economic
statistics, we believe the U.K. At the present time offers
better value and we hold strategic investments in that market,"
it said in a statement.
    Adsteam did not name any British investments but it has
disclosed a stake in Blue Circle Industries Plc ltBCIL.L>, last
stated by Adsteam in London at 6.85 pct in late February.
    Adsteam said it was continuing to look for investment
opportunities both in Australia and overseas, but with the
Australian stock market at record levels, opportunities to
acquire companies on reasonable investment criteria were
limited.
    As earlier reported, Adsteam will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for
working capital and investment both in Australia and overseas
through a oneforfive rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a share.
    "We expect to enter 1988 in a highly liquid position and
will be looking to take advantage of investment opportunities
as they arise," it said.
    Nevertheless, Adsteam said it continues to be a large
investor in the Australian market through its equityaccounted
associates and through other major investments.
    "We have enjoyed a very substantial increase in the market
value of our investments over the course of this financial
year, but we are concerned at the economic fundamentals which
persist in Australia, particularly the high interest rates
which currently apply," it said.
    Adsteam also said it had hedged part of its Australian
stock market portfolio in the futures market and had hedged all
foreign currency borrowings.
    Realised losses from futures hedging have been brought to
account as extraordinary items but unrealised gains from
investments significantly exceed realised and unrealised losses
on hedging, Adsteam said.
    In its earlier reported first half ended December 31,
Adsteam posted an extraordinary loss of 20.39 mln dlrs against
a 13.79 mln profit a year earlier.
    Equityaccounted net profit before extraordinaries rose to
75.05 mln dlrs from 55.68 mln a year earlier.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS URGED TO RESTRAIN PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke
called on businessmen to hold their salaries and profit margins
as part of his campaign for economic restraint.
    In a speech to the National Press Club, Hawke said business
"must not puncture the spirit of community restraint" evident in
low wage increases and suppressed consumer demand.
    Hawke said the Federal Government would coordinate with
State administrations to monitor prices and profit margins.
    "At a time when a concerted national effort to restrain
costs is required, profit margins should not be increased," he
said.
    Direct price control did not appeal to the government, but
it would act to ensure market forces operated fairly and
businesses were reminded of their obligations to Australia,
Hawke said.
    The government would demonstrate its commitment with
spending cuts in its May 14 economic statement, he said.
    It would also limit increases in government excises
normally indexed to inflation to about six pct, Hawke said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN TERMS OF TRADE WORSEN IN LAST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Australias terms of trade fell by a
further 3.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after declining
0.8 pct in the third quarter and 2.7 pct a year earlier, the
Statistics Bureau said.
    It said the seasonally adjusted current account deficit of
3.22 billion dlrs in the quarter would have dropped to 912 mln
if not for the terms of trade decline.
    The fourth quarter decline followed a 1.1 pct fall in
export prices and a 2.4 pct rise in import prices, it said.
    The Bureau noted Australias terms of trade had fallen by
19.9 pct since the fourth quarter of 1983.

<TITLE>CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark ONeill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>China has to decide if it will increase
sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and
rising demand, in view of market predictions that international
sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the
official press said.
    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the
purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in
production last year but he gave no price details.
    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly
because of improving living standards and rising demand for
sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.
    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a
statecontrolled economy. China may have to import," he said.
    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in
1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in
January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.
    The official Economic Information newspaper last month said
production in the 1986/87 crushing season SeptemberApril
will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.
    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24
mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.
    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet
has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped
and cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.
    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw
down stocks to meet market demand," it added.
    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the
drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane
and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers
refusing to grow them.
    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three
times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to
seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could
sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only
70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.
    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have
not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.
    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan
in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills profit to 117
yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.
    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the
442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing
money. China has 521 sugar mills.
    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane
acreage in 1986/87 SeptemberAugust of up to 10 pct in
Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of Chinas sugar in calendar
1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of
Chinas sugar in calendar 1985.
    He said both provinces are more developed than other
sugarproducing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.
    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for
28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,
because canegrowing is more economic there, he said.
    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.
    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln
at endJanuary. "Now they are falling but they have not
reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"
he said.
    "China has options not easily available in western
countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less
into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.
    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be
slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices
and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are
likely to continue until at least end1988.
    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the stateowned
mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.
    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of
them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.
    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual
four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.

<TITLE>JAPAN DENIES BREAKING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan denied breaking a pact with the
U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact
were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the
accord.
    "We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of
course there are some problems," a spokesman for the
International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.
    He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the
agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks
of unsellable products. "We are aiming to reduce production in
Japan but of course this takes time," he said.
    The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling
chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added "It
is only a matter of time before we solve this problem."
    The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large
quantities of chips at knockdown prices to the United States
and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in
Japan.
    The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on
President Reagan in a nonbinding resolution to retaliate
against Japan for violating the agreement.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN BEEF OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Australian beef output is forecast to
decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln
in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and
LiveStock Corp AMLC said.
    Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to
480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and
then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of
its biannual meat and livestock forecasts.
    It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level
of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is
expected to be slower than previously forecast.
    Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher
returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will
continue, the AMLC said.
    The slow herd buildup and the forecast lower production is
expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and
domestic consumption this year, it said.
    The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production
levels until late next year.
    It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of
output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55
pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.
    The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of
production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the
Australian dollar, the AMLC said.
    It also forecast that Australias four major markets, the
U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the
chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively
around 94 pct of total Australian exports.

<TITLE>JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the
states Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict
tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year
starting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association of
Japan said.
    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more
than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln
compensated gross registered tonnes CGRT a year against
capacity of about six mln CGRT.
    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT
in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.
    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply
nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport
Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling
of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.
    The cartels, selfimposed and selfregulated, are not
legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to
stick to them.
    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen
and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.

    A team will visit Washington next month for talks with
World Bank executives and to ask for 200 mln dlrs from the

see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges, ending with only
one winner in Asia.
    But surprisingly, the challenges now appear to be coming
from the other side of the world, they said.
    The Chicago Board of Trade CBOT will introduce night
trading in its U.S. Treasury bond contract on April 30, which
could clash with SIMEX morning activity, banking sources said.
    The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2,
but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare.
    The London International Financial Futures Exchange LIFFE
could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a U.S. Treasury
bond contract that can be offset on the CBOT, they said. Such a
LIFFE contract is expected later this year.
    LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, where
average daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in
February from 1,286 last October when the bonds were first
introduced.
    The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the
rapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bonds
in Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more
stable, traders said.
    Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also
inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore
and Sydney, the banking sources said.
    Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with
the last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of
50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at
65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael
Killian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp.
    Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session
might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit
from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end
of 1987. SIMEX also became more competitive after this months
budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures
margin deposits.
    Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX
trading by nonbank institutions and individuals and would
benefit foreign firms and institutions.
    While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat
disappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, Fong
Yew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters.
    Volume in the SIMEXs Nikkei stock index, based on the
Tokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than
1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October,
helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo
stocks, Fong said.
    Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year,
reached a record 2,697 on February 26.
    Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential
for expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the
contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising
cash market in Tokyo.
    SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts.
In February, total volume on the exchange reached a record
122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of
116,767 set in September. Eurodollar volume reached a record
78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in September.
    SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving
into options soon, but competition continues regionally as well
as globally, banking sources said.
    The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share
index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which
equity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity
than the ordinary index, banking sources said.
    Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may
also flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a threeway link
with Chicago and London, traders in Sydney said.
    LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT, they said.

<TITLE>EMPEROR MINES TO FLOAT GOLD INVESTMENT COMPANY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Fiji gold miner ltEmperor Mines Ltd>
said it will float a gold investment company in the Isle of Man
to be known as ltOdin Mining and Investment Co Ltd>.
    Sixty pct of Odins 51 mln issued shares will be offered to
Emperor shareholders on a oneforone nonrenounceable basis at
1.20 Australian dlrs each, it said in a statement.
    Each share will carry a free option exercisable at the same
price up to March 1992.
    Odin in turn will be allotted a 10 pct stake in Emperor at
6.06 dlrs a share against the market level of about 7.70 dlrs.
    Odin shares will be listed in Australia and New Zealand.
    Emperor said Odins chief activity would be strategic
investment in emerging gold companies and projects.
    Emperors 22 pct stake in Australias ltNullarbor Holdings
Ltd> and 10 pct stake in Canadas ltOsborne and Chappel
Goldfields Ltd> will be transferred to Odin at substantial
discounts to their market prices, it said.
    The offer will not be available to shareholders registered
in the U.S. And Britain in view of compliance costs, it said.
    But David Kingston, of advisers ltRothschild Australia Ltd>,
told Reuters those few shareholders were being urged to switch
their registrations to an Australian nominee.
    Kingston said about 65 to 70 pct of Emperors shareholders
are domiciled outside Australia, but the vast majority are
registered through Australian nominees and are thus entitled to
participate.
    Stockbroker ltOrd Minnett Ltd> will underwrite the issue,
Emperor said.
    Odin shares are expected to be listed in May, it added.
    Emperor changed its domicile to the Isle of Man from
Australia last October because of changes in Australian tax
laws that would affect its tax position, even though it has no
activities in Australia.

    The bill, which must still be approved by parliament, would

of its Malaysian palm oil imports through a countertrade deal
involving the construction of two bridges valued at 20 mln

    He said Malaysia agreed to the oilforbridges deal in
October after India said it could no longer buy some 700,000
tonnes of palm oil a year because of its trade deficit.
    Malaysia has also agreed to barter palm oil for 30 mln dlrs
of hydroelectric equipment and is interested in countertrading
for Indian iron ore, wheat and other goods and services, he
said.

<TITLE>JAPAN CLARIFIES FUND MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has clarified
regulations governing fund management, satisfying overseas
critics who charged the rules were too tightlydrawn, ministry
officials and Western diplomats said.
    They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreign
fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its
Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well.
    A foreign investment management company will be permitted
to employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another on
standby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.
    In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm
is eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will take
account of the amount of funds the parent company has under
management, a ministry official said.
    "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the
criteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.
    He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment
management licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms,
including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensed
under the new law passed late last year.

    Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan

<TITLE>SUBROTO SEES OIL MARKET CONTINUING BULLISH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying
demand expected to rise later in the year.
    He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a
twoday meeting of SouthEast Asian Energy Ministers that he
saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will
continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth
quarters," Subroto said.
    Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said "I think
they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little
turbulence ..."
    "Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official
price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added.

Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate
capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried
forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker
said.
    Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on
its financial resources had been stopped, but after
extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986
was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.
    The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it
necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.
    However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through
a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs
of credit into a subordinated loan.

<TITLE>OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.
    He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that
OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.
    "We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production
is less than 15.8 mln at the moment," he stated.
    Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went
above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the
next OPEC meeting in June. "We will discuss the market situation
then," he added.
    He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had
been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting."
    He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due
to meet in Vienna this week.

<TITLE>JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A Foreign Ministry official dismissed
arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to
block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.
    "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"
Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministrys North American
Division told Reuters.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
White House to consider blocking the sale of ltFairchild
Semiconductor Corp> to Japans Fujitsu Ltd ltITSU.T>, U.S.
Officials said yesterday.
    Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.
    U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while
Japans supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.
    Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,
Schlumberger Ltd ltSLB>, does not include Fairchilds main
defencerelated division.
    In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
supercomputers.
    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchase
would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
market."
    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
U.S. Firms technological lead in the field.
    "The United States believes Japan will only react when
bullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asia
analyst Carole Ryavec said.
    However, the analysts said more is at stake than
supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
    "The real issue is xenophobia in the U.S. Silicon Valley,"
said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
    U.S.Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japans Ministry of
International Trade and Industry MITI to get Japanese firms
to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
and opening Japans market.
    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
set by the pact.
    "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"
he told Reuters.
    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

<TITLE>REAGAN DID NOT RECALL APPROVING ARMS DEAL, COUNSEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagans legal adviser said
the President could not recall when he approved a 1985 arms
sale to Iran, the New York Times reported.
    "We were trying to stimulate his Reagans recollection and
he had no recollection, although he remembered being surprised
about something," Peter Wallison, who is resigning, was quoted
as saying in an interview.
    "That led us to expect that he would not be able to recall
the date when he appeared before the Tower board," Wallison
said, referring to the question of whether Reagan gave prior
approval to an Israeli shipment of U.S. Arms to Iran.
    Wallison said John Poindexter, then head of the National
Security Council NSC, kept him from probing the scandal for
weeks after it was first made public last November, the Times
reported.
    Wallison told the newspaper that Poindexter, who resigned
from his NSC post last November 25, refused to give him
information about the deal, despite pleas by former White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan.
    "Regan told me on several occasions that he had been unable
to move Poindexter to include me in any of the discussions or
to provide me with ... The facts," he said.

<TITLE>NAKASONE REFUSES TO DROP SALES TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japans Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
has refused to drop a proposed sales tax as debate on a draft
budget for 1987 resumed after a nineday opposition boycott.
    "I have no plan to withdraw the sales tax as I think it is
the best policy for Japan," Nakasone told the budget committee
of the lower house of parliament.
    Kyodo News Agency said a small group of members of
Nakasones ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a complaint
with their local headquarters calling for his expulsion from
the party on the grounds he broke a campaign pledge by
introducing the sales tax.
    Nakasone admitted the tax was a major factor in an upper
house byelection defeat for his party on Sunday.
    The election was the first nationallevel poll since
Nakasone presented his plan for overhauling Japans tax system,
which has remained unaltered for the past 36 years.
    The sales tax and the planned abolition of the taxfree
saving system are designed to offset proposed income and
corporate tax cuts.

<TITLE>BELGIAN GOVERNMENT REACHES BUDGETARY ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Senior Belgian cabinet ministers
reached an agreement on budgetary economies, which will allow
the net budgetary financing requirement to remain within
previously set limits, the government said in a statement.
    The statement, issued as ministers ended a marathon meeting
in the early hours of this morning, did not give further
details.
    However, Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt said before the
meeting he was seeking economies of at least 21.2 billion
francs in order to keep the financing requirement at 418
billion francs this year, or eight pct of Gross National
Product.
    The government set this figure as its target for the
financing requirement last year when it announced a program of
cuts designed to reduce spending by 195 billion francs in 1987.
    However, Verhofstadt had claimed that subsequent
developments had meant that unless further cuts were found, the
financing requirement would be considerably higher.
    Last year, Belgium had a financing requirement of 561
billion francs, or 11.0 pct of GNP.
    A government spokeswoman said the accord would be
considered by the full cabinet later today, and Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens would announce it to Parliament on Monday.
    She said no details would be made public before then.

<TITLE>TAX REVENUES BOOST U.K. BUDGET OPTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A mix of electoral boldness and fiscal
caution is expected from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson next week when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987/88.
    Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very
favourable budget options with which to please voters, industry
and financial markets alike.
    The budget will Lawsons fourth, and probably the last from
the Conservative government before the next general election,
political analysts say.
    Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will
balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing, and
allow for fresh falls in U.K. Interest rates.
    They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending
has helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
PSBR for financial 1986/87 from an originally targetted 7.1
billion stg, despite big rises in government spending.
    Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to
split between income tax cuts and other electoral "sweeteners,"
higher spending and a drop in borrowing, while still meeting
his earlier 1987/88 PSBR target of 7.0 billion stg.
    The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that
socalled "fiscal adjustement" to maximise the governments
allround popularity ahead of the next general election.
    Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawsons
budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home
consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support
from overseas investors.
    Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said "a budget which
concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for
an early election."
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before
June, 1988. But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot
has risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter
surveys. Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this
year add to arguments for an early poll, analysts say.
    The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of
taxation in the U.K. From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct.
    While confirming that aim, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in
the near future. She said in a television interview that it
would happen "Eventually. But I think it will be eventually."
    Most market analysts now expect a twopence reduction in
the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of
income tax from 60 pct.
    A one billion stg cut in the 1987/88 PSBR  to six billion
stg  is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial
markets, they add.
    The Treasurys inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed
that previously envisaged, economists say. Lawson as recently
as December 17 said that "I very much doubt whether there will
be much scope for reductions in taxation in next years budget."
    The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate
of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every pound
off the tax base would make the opposition Labour Partys
spending plans look more painful to the electorate, analysts
say.
    The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the
basic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in
1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show.
    Lawsons budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at
1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the governments distinct tone of
optimism, analysts say.
     The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will
be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic
achievements and confidence for the future, they add.
    But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 by
between one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict,
Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR
than the outturn for this financial year.M
    That could leave him with a presentation problem,
economists say.
    A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring
markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government
would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budgets
arithmetic seem overoptimistic, economists say
    Lawson is slated to reaffirm the governments goals, as set
out in its Medium Term Financial Strategy MTFS, of reducing
inflation and raising economic growth.
    Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him to
drop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M3, while
retaining the tamer M0 narrow measure. Few foresee any other
monetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting.
    Analysts were surprised this week when the government
sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates, in an
attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market. Analysts
had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget.
    Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated
after the budget. Many analysts foresee them falling by as much
as a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level.
    The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is
to cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation,
analysts say. Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage
rate reduces retail prices by 0.4 pct, government figures show.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO WIDEN PARTICIPATION IN TELECOM SERVICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japan agreed in talks with the U.S. To
amend its laws to allow more companies to engage in
international valueadded network telecommunications services,
a Post and Telecommunications Ministry official said.
    Such services make communications between otherwise
incompatible computers possible over telecommunications lines.
    The official said firms registering as "Special Type Two
Telecommunications Firms," which are those leasing lines from
common carriers, will be permitted to release the lines to
users and provide international services.
    Steps will also be taken to assure fairness in negotiations
between common carriers and firms seeking to lease lines, the
official said.
    Since December, 10 companies have registered as Special
Type Two firms, including two which have American Telephone and

<TITLE>NORDBANKEN POSTPONES PLANNED AUCTION OF FERMENTA SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Swedens Nordbanken banking group

said it would postpone indefinitely its planned auction on
Monday of 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by
Fermentas ltFRMS ST> founder and former chief executive Reefat
elSayed.
    A statement cited Fermentas financial position as the main
reason for delay. The companys 1986 deficit had earlier been
estimated at 136 mln crowns, but that was revised at an
extraordinary shareholders meeting last Monday to half a
billion crowns. The company said at the meeting a planned new
share issue would not be launched but that another, estimated
to raise 580 mln crowns, was scheduled for April.
    Nordbanken said the auction was the natural result of a
debtors inability to repay an overdue loan. Although it
expected to buy the shares back itself, it did not exclude
accepting a suitable bid for them.
    Nordbanken loaned 200 mln crowns to Reefat elSayed
privately and is Fermentas largest creditor with loans of l55
mln crowns.
    It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month
agreed to advance Fermenta 110 mln crowns to solve its
immediate liquidity problems.

<TITLE>KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Kampuchea harvested more than two mln
tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous
two years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday.
    Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than
one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.
    SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln
to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln
tonnes this calendar year.
    Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes
of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
minimum its 7.5 mln people need.

<TITLE>CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT, PAPER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Chinas 1987 cotton output must rise
above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall
short of increasing demand, the China Daily said.
    Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.
    Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a
record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily
attributed the decline to several factors, including less
favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict
cotton production after the 1984 buildup of stocks.
    According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to
558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.
    To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct
the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota
levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies
will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally
contracted for, it added.
    The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south
China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be
concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.
    It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate
production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other
crops, but gave no more details.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a
parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is
not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
    Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major

    The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid
fluctuation of exchange rates, he said.
    The accord stipulated that current rates reflect

    There is a 10 basis point utilisation fee if the
underwriters are required to pick up more than 67 pct of the
paper issued, and a five basis point fee if they are to pick up
3467 pct of the paper. No utilisation fee will be charged if
they are to pick up less than 33 pct.
    Underwriting fee is 1/8 pct.
    Under the facility, notes in denominations of 500,000 dlrs

<TITLE>JAPAN BROKERS SEEK 10 YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses have asked the
Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of
10year government bonds, securities sources said.
    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the
Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses
for 10year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industrys 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

<TITLE>PETROBRAS CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils state oil company
Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit
guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose
reasons, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis
were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after
Brazils decision to halt interest payment of its commercial
debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents
two days of consumption.
    He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept
letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi
banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees
from leading international banks.
    In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from
the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazils second biggest
oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main
supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am
sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from
elsewhere," Santana added.
    Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to
respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the
order to cancel the shipment.
    The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous
shipment, he added. "We telexed them saying that if they
insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the
product elsewhere," Santana said.
    After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract, the
Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of
Brazils credit guarantees, he said.

<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A Mannesmann AG ltMMWG.F> spokesman
said the company has lodged an application with the Federal
Cartel Office for approval of a possible majority stake in car
parts company ltFichtel und Sachs AG>.
    He described the application as a precautionary move and
said no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been
reached. Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to
buy a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm
Sachs, the grandson of the firms founder.
    The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the
other shares to create a majority stake in the firm.
    Fichtels other principal shareholders are Commerzbank AG
ltCBKG.F>, with 35.01 pct, and Salzgitter AG ltISLG.F>, with
24.98 pct. Spokesmen declined to comment directly on the
possibility of selling Fichtel shares to Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct
stake in Fichtels holding company Sachs AG in the first
quarter.
    Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of
intent on the 37.5 pct stake but completion was being delayed
by legal questions surrounding the inheritance.

<TITLE>SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BASLE, Switzerland, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Sandoz AG ltSANZ.Z> would
have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double
figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for
Novembers warehouse fire, a senior company official said.
    The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters
Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with
the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which
caused severe pollution of the Rhine.
    Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits
to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct
increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.
    This year began well, with the performance in January and
February at least equal to the same period last year, the
official said.
    The company is expected to give fuller details of its
results at a news conference on April 22.
    Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover
any liability arising from the accident.
    The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the
"one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary
gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution
from the fire.
    Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been
flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the
Rhine since the accident.
    However, the official said the final figure would be "much
less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further
details.
    In line with fellow chemical giant CibaGeigy ltCIGZ.Z>,
which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also
hit by the falling dollar, the official said.
    Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with
market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this
was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange
effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to
8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.
    Net profit at CibaGeigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion
francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.
    The third major Swiss chemical company, F. HoffmannLa
Roche and Co ltHOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results.

approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
our industrial environment does not worsen."
    He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
losses.
    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
    Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
    Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
1985.
    But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
to restate the previous five years accounts to eliminate
rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
asset.
    Together with other oneoff charges, Alusuisse took an
gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
472 mln in 1985.
    It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
1985.
    Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
1985, had wiped out the companys remaining reserves and
exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
    Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical
elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the
foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
    Haerri said despite the losses, the companys liquidity was
strong. Bank debt had been cut by about onethird to 2.56
billion francs against the end1985 level of 3.85 billion.
    Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
in 1985.
    In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
arranged with three major Swiss banks  Union Bank of
Switzerland ltSBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp ltSBVZ.Z> and Credit
Suisse ltCRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
subordinated loan.
    The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
    Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
    That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
    The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders equity of
1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
alternations were made for previous years.
    After 1986 losses, shareholders equity stood at only 895
mln francs.

<TITLE>JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS IN LAST 1986 QUARTER UP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Current profits of Japans major firms in
the OctoberDecember quarter rose four pct from a year earlier
to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct yearonyear rise in the
preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct
profit increase in nonmanufacturing industries, supported by
an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in
real estate, according to a ministry survey.
    Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen
or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217
billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.
    Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth
quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1
pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.
    Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell
3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall
the previoius quarter.
    Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese
economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if
economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is
heading for a recovery.

Alusuisse plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium

    Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September,
company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000
tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000

<TITLE>MAJOR DIVESTMENT PLANS OUTLINED FOR SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Singapore government should
reduce its stake in major stateowned or run companies like
Singapore Airlines Ltd ltAIRH.SI> to around 30 pct over the next
decade and privatise statutory boards, a government report
said.
    The report of the Public Sector Divestment Committee also
recommended flotation of as many governmentlinked companies
glcs as possible, and secondary distribution of stateowned
shares to add breadth and depth to the Singapore stock market.
    The Singapore government owns or backs 608 companies under
three holding companies with total assets in access of 10
billion dlrs, the report said.
    The report said a study of 99 glcs showed that 41 of them
should be privatised, 52 should not be privatised, and six
should be studied further because they have foreign government
participation, serve a "social mission," or are defencerelated.
    Of the 41, 15 should seek listing on The Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System SESDAQ,
including shipyards, printing firms and airport service firms.
    The government should privatise a further 17, including
Intraco Ltd a government trading firm, Chemical Industries
FE Ltd, and Acma Electrical Industries Ltd, and reduce its
stake in nine, it added.
    These included Singapore Airlines, SIA, now 63 pctowned by
the governments Temasek Holdings, The Development Bank of
Singapore ltDBSM.SI>, Keppel Corp Ltd ltKPLM.SI>, Sembawang
Shipyard Ltd ltBAWH.SI> and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.
    The ceiling on foreign ownership of SIA should be allowed
to rise to 49 pct from the current 20 pct, it said.
    "The committee recommends that Temasek Holdings reduces its
stake in SIA in tranches to around 30 pct. The size and
timing of each tranche would depend on the absorptive capacity
of the Singapore stock market," it added.
    Trading in shares of SIA, which has a paidup capital of
619 mln dlrs, closed here today at 10.60 dlrs.
    The report said the governments 48 pct stake in DBS, one
of Singapores four major local banks, should be cut to 30 pct
through public offerings or dilution by issuing new shares.
    Among firms which should not be privatised, nine are to be
wound up, it said, including storage and food trading firms.
    The report said seven statutory boards should be considered
for privatisation so as to reduce competition with the private
sector, with a 20 pct ceiling on foreign ownership.
    The seven include the Telecommunications Authority of
Singapore, the Public Utilities Board, the Port of Singapore
Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the
Singapore Broadcasting Corp.
    The latter is least able to be privatised because of the
sensitivity of its activities, it said.
    "The others can be privatised only after various issues have
been thoroughly debated and adequate safeguards formulated for
postprivatisation control and regulation," it added.
    "The committee recommends that as many governmentlinked
companies as possible should be privatised," the report said.
    But it added that there should be "a policy of robust
privatisation where initiative is decentralised and order is
maintained through adequate monitoring, control and direction."
    The committees findings will be subject to final approval
from the Ministry of Finance.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japans Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
has refused to drop a proposed sales tax as debate on a draft
budget for 1987 resumed after a nineday opposition boycott.
    "I have no plan to withdraw the sales tax as I think it is
the best policy for Japan," Nakasone told the budget committee
of the lower house of parliament.
    Kyodo News Agency said a small group of members of
Nakasones ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a complaint
with their local headquarters calling for his expulsion from
the party on the grounds he broke a campaign pledge by
introducing the sales tax.
    Nakasone admitted the tax was a major factor in an upper
house byelection defeat for his party on Sunday.
    The election was the first nationallevel poll since
Nakasone presented his plan for overhauling Japans tax system,
which has remained unaltered for the past 36 years.
    The sales tax and the planned abolition of the taxfree
saving system are designed to offset proposed income and
corporate tax cuts.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTER SAYS ABOUT 170 YEN APPROPRIATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>International Trade and Industry Minister

mediumsized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yens
rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen.

stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels. The
dollar had closed here at 153.77 yen on February 20.

<TITLE>FRENCH 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT REVISED DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Frances 1986 budget deficit has been
revised down to 141.1 billion francs from the estimate at the
end of last year of 143.6 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
    This compares with the 1985 budget deficit of 153.3 billion
francs and the deficit target for this year of 129 billion.
    The ministry said it was the first time since 1980 that the
final budget deficit had been below the initial target.
    The budget deficit corresponded to 2.87 pct of the gross
domestic product GDP, down from 3.35 pct in 1985.
    This year the government is aiming to cut the budget
deficit to 2.5 pct, reducing it further to two pct in 1988.
    Expenditure totalled 1,228 billion francs last year, up 6.1
pct from 1985, while receipts rose 7.3 pct to 1,076 billion.
    The 1986 budget deficit excludes IMF credits and activities
of the exchange stabilisation fund, but takes account of a four
billion franc payment to the public debt depreciation fund from
income from the privatisation programme.
    The ministry also said that the 1986 expenditure total
included the integration into the general budget of Treasury
loans to the steel industry, which had a neutral impact on the
deficit but boosted the spending figure.

<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 12  </DATELINE><BODY>Two small shipping companies have
reached a pay deal with striking seamen, but union leaders said
most of Brazils 40,000 seamen were still on strike.
    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had
accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies, Globo and
Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.
    The twoweek strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and

    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will
not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal
last Friday.

he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying
demand expected to rise later in the year.
    He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a

saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will
continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth
quarters," Subroto said.
    Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said "I think
they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little
turbulence ..."
    "Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official
price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added.

<TITLE>OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.
    He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that
OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.
    "We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production
is less than 15.8 mln at the moment," he stated.
    Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went
above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the
next OPEC meeting in June. "We will discuss the market situation
then," he added.
    He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had
been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting."
    He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due
to meet in Vienna this week.

rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances
appears to be waning, and longterm efforts are required to cut

    Japans trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain

    Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan
hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of
resources and maintain the free trade system, it added.

<TITLE>JAPAN CLARIFIES FUND MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has clarified
regulations governing fund management, satisfying overseas
critics who charged the rules were too tightlydrawn, ministry
officials and Western diplomats said.
    They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreign
fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its
Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well.
    A foreign investment management company will be permitted
to employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another on
standby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.
    In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm
is eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will take
account of the amount of funds the parent company has under
management, a ministry official said.
    "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the
criteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.
    He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment
management licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms,
including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensed
under the new law passed late last year.

<TITLE>AIRBUS FACES A340 DECISION AS DEADLINE LOOMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Guy Collins, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOULOUSE, FRANCE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The supervisory board of the
European consortium, ltAirbus Industrie>, has begun a critical
meeting to review government funding and airline orders for its
proposed A340 long range jet, Airbus officials here said.
    Airbus insists it needs five airlines to firmly commit
themselves to the plane before going ahead with the project by
the months end, the deadline for its launch.
    The plane, a fourengined widebodied jet, has so far only
been bought by one airline  ltLufthansa>, which has placed 15
firm orders and 15 options for the plane.
    But while Air France has said it wants to buy seven of the
aircraft, it has not yet formally placed an order. Discussions
with up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in
public commitments.
    Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an
uphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the
2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but
its sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium
range jet with many identical components.
    The British government remains unconvinced that there will
be sufficient room in the world long range jet market.
    The West German government is also uncommitted, and is
currently pressing for a restructuring of the consortiums West
German company, ltDeutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French
government appears to be fully behind the program.
    Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane
has been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last
October with ltCFM International> that its CFM56 engine with
28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December,
Airbus announced an agreement with CFM rival ltInternational
Aero Engine> IAE to power a slightly larger version of the
A340 with a 30,000 lb thrust hightechnology superfan engine.
   Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE
engine is now the principle engine for the project.  The
incorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper
more attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be
developed and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism
that the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.
    The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right
decision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it
could find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by
staying absent from the long range jet market or by committing
itself to a commercially unviable project.

<TITLE>AIRBUS HAS NINE COMMITTED CUSTOMERS FOR A330/340</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Airbus Industrie consortium
has obtained a total of 104 commitments from nine customers for
its planned A340 longrange jet and A330 twinengined
mediumrange jet, the consortium said in a communique here.
    Its supervisory board, meeting in Toulouse, "concluded that
the commercial and industrial objectives ... Have been
fulfilled and that a strong basis for a commercially successful
programme has been established," the communique said.
    But the consortium still has to obtain funding guarantees
from its member governments for the 2.5 billion dlr programme.
    The nine committed customers are well above the five
airlines that the consortium said it needed to launch the plane
project.
    "Therefore the supervisory board has decided to take all
necessary steps for a formal launch decision by midApril 1987
to ensure first deliveries of the A340 in May 1992, to be
followed by first deliveries of the A330 a year later," it said.
    Airbus is a fournation consortium grouping Britain,
France, West Germany and Spain.

<TITLE>REAGAN DID NOT RECALL APPROVING ARMS DEAL, COUNSEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagans legal adviser said
the President could not recall when he approved a 1985 arms
sale to Iran, the New York Times reported.
    "We were trying to stimulate his Reagans recollection and
he had no recollection, although he remembered being surprised
about something," Peter Wallison, who is resigning, was quoted
as saying in an interview.
    "That led us to expect that he would not be able to recall
the date when he appeared before the Tower board," Wallison
said, referring to the question of whether Reagan gave prior
approval to an Israeli shipment of U.S. Arms to Iran.
    Wallison said John Poindexter, then head of the National
Security Council NSC, kept him from probing the scandal for
weeks after it was first made public last November, the Times
reported.
    Wallison told the newspaper that Poindexter, who resigned
from his NSC post last November 25, refused to give him
information about the deal, despite pleas by former White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan.
    "Regan told me on several occasions that he had been unable
to move Poindexter to include me in any of the discussions or
to provide me with ... The facts," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administrations opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a lineitem veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. Weve had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like theyre on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the longrun
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflationinduced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Offices Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options for reducing the budget deficit
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nations history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the GrammRudmanHollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because theres no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by onetime measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

<TITLE>COURT PUTS INJUNCTION ON DUTCH PORT REDUNDANCIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Employers in Rotterdam ports
strikehit general cargo sector have been served with an
injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with
plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers
organisation spokesman said.
    An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal
fault in the employers redundancy procedure.
    The employers spokesman said they were likely to restart
the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to
preempt the May 7 final court ruling.
    Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller
described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but
added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that
has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was
resolved.
    Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sectors
4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the
campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in
protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this
year.
    The employers said there were no immediate plans for
meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or
on a new work practice agreement in the sector.
    Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the
ports grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated,
although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector,
the employers spokesman added.

<TITLE>SPANISH FARMERS BLOCK ROADS IN EC PROTEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Spanish farmers took their tractors to
the roads today and blocked a border crossing with France in a
protest against the Socialist governments EC policies,
officials said.
    Protestors set cars ablaze and cut off traffic in the Rioja
wine growing district, while they blocked roads with tractor
convoys in other northern regions such as Saragossa, where
5,000 farmers joined the demonstrations.
    Farmers blockaded the border crossing with France at La
Junquera near Barcelona, refusing to allow lorries from other
European countries to enter Spain.
    Spanish farmers have been protesting for the past two weeks
to demand a better deal within the Community. The farm protest
came in the wake of demonstrations last night in over 30 cities
in which workers marched for wage rises and against job losses.
    But the turnout, regarded as a dress rehearsal for a
general strike next month, disappointed the communistled
Workers Commissions union organisers. The ruling Socialist
Partys trade union arm, the General Workers Union, did not
join in.
    More than 20 strikes are planned for this month and next in
the transport sector, with stoppages at the stateowned Iberia
and Aviaco airlines and RENFE railways.

<TITLE>U.S. PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Producer Price Index for
finished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in
February, the Labor Department said.
    The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer
prices in January.
    Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the
increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than
they had in January, the department said.
    The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February,
1986 level.
    Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods
stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.
    Among finished goods, the index for energy products rose
four pct in February after a 9.8 pct increase in January. But
price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating
oil, the department said.
    There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall
for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January
levels. This reflected expanded factoryfinanced rebates and
discount loan programs, the department said.

discount loan programs, the department said.
    The index for consumer foods fell 0.5 pct after a 1.8
pct drop in January as vegetables, pork and coffee cost less.
The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp
0.9 pct rise in January.
    The department said that energy prices again were the main
reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct.
    Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher,
half the 10 pct jump recorded in January.
    The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1
pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for
steel, precious metals and copper stabilized.
    The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while
hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index
rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude
energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct
rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month
after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January.
    Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco,
but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap.
    Among finished goods, gasoline rose 5.5 pct after a 15.7
pct January increase, and fuel oil was up three pct in February
after an 18.0 pct increase in January.

<DATELINE>    OAKLAND, Calif., March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Dreyers Grand Ice Cream said
it has restated its previouslyreported fourth quarter loss to
904,000 dlrs or 13 cts per share because it has now decided to
take a charge of about 700,000 dlrs to provide for losses of
Midwest Distributing Co, which was acquired December 30.
    Dreyers said the restatement reduces net income for the
full year to 5,914,000 dlrs or 80 cts per share.
    The company said the restatement does not indicate any
change in its thinking on the benefits of the acquisition or
future prospects in Midwest Distributings markets.
    Dreyers Grand previously reported 1986 earnings of
6,614,000 dlrs or 90 cts per share, down from 7,960,000 dlrs or
1.08 dlrs a share.  For the first nine months of the year, it
had earned 6,818,000 dlrs or 92 cts per share, up from
6,354,000 dlrs or 86 cts a share a year before.

<TITLE>JAPAN BROKERS SEEK 10 YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses have asked the
Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of
10year government bonds, securities sources said.
    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the
Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses
for 10year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industrys 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

<TITLE>VW DISMISSES HEAD OF ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG ltVOWG.F> said it has
dismissed the head of its foreign exchange department and
suspended several other staff members following the recent
emergence of a possible currency fraud at the company.
    A VW statement said foreign exchange department chief
Burkhard Junger had been dismissed with immediate effect.
    It said it has also suspended Guenther Borchert, head of
the financial transfer department, and Siegfried Mueller, head
of the central cash and currency clearing department. Four
other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended.
    VW said the possibly fraudulent foreign currency
transactions, which could cost the company 480 mln marks, fell
directly within the area of responsibility of Borchert and
Mueller.
    VW said Adalbert Sedlmair, formerly finance director at
VWs former office equipment subsidiary TriumphAdler AG, would
temporarily take over responsibility of the financial transfer
department during Borcherts suspension from duties.
    Meanwhile, the state prosecutors office in Brunswick,
which is looking into the currency transactions, said the
Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden had also joined the
investigation and would be responsible for measures such as
possible police searches.
    A spokeswoman for the office said prosecutors in Frankfurt
were looking into the possibility of taking over the VW case
but added a final decision would be taken next week.
    The short VW statement said, "Burkhard Junger, 39, who had
already been suspended from his duties in January, has been
dismissed with immediate effect."
    Company sources said Borchert and Mueller were not thought
to have been directly involved with the currency transactions
but they may have been lax in their supervision.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW 3RD WLD FINANCE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The United States this week signaled
it is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted with
providing large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop new
ways of financing that will prove more acceptable to both
sides.
    Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy,
U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be made
to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflationfree growth.
    In particular, they stress new techniques that shift the
emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates.
    "The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or
concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in
debtequity swaps and that sort of thing," a Reagan
administration official said of the slow pace of commercial
bank lending to the Third World.
    "The debtors have been performing well...some people argue
that taking 11/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness.
Well if thats what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowing
of the spread that could be charged on new money," the official
said.
    This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing
for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial
payment of interest in tradeable investment notes.
    On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker
told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative
one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister
Jamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official told
Reuters this week the Philippines proposal to partially pay
interest with investment notes instead of cash should be
considered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks,
officials now say, is expected soon.
    "New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the
fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank
loans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. As
you know, theres been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money," said the
official, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.
    The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker
and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29
billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors
undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.
    But it has taken almost six months to complete the
syndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has
created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large
straight cash loans being assembled ever again.
    U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping
their debts for equity in local corporations  a development
that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico  but to
pin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest
directly in debtor country private sectors.
    These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater
stake and more economically secure return on investment.
    In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month
declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up
with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of
its 109 billion dlr debt burden.
    The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and
dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its
foreeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third Worlds largest.
    One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian
Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said "theyve come in here now
and said "Look, were out of money, help us," but they havent
come in with a plan. And theyve gone all over the world, and
at every stop theyve been told the same thing."
    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible
economic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or
the International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy
before commercial banks would begin negotiations.
    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and
major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach
agreements stretching out debt repayments.
    For its part, the administration has signaled its strong
support for new techniques that in some cases effectively
amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.
    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead
of biannual interest payments, speeding an accord.
    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have
also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in
building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.
    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB15, under which
banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate
loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it
is believed payments will resume.
    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and
energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,
has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.
    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that
provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade
legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.
    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.

<TITLE>APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS ltABIO> LOWERS SALES FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FOSTER CITY, Calif., March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Applied Biosystems Inc said
it has lowered its internal product sales forecast following a
review of market conditions in Europe.
    The company also said Chairman Sam Eletr has resigned for
personal reasons.
    The company said it now expects third quarter, ending March
31, sales to approximate the second quarters 21.1 mln dlrs and
third quarter earnings to be less than the second quarters 2.7
mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, due to unexpected European
softness and previously announced new product delays.
    Applied Biosystems earned 2,654,000 dlrs, or 20 cts a
share, in 1986s third quarter on sales of 13.4 mln dlrs.
    Explaining European orders have not materialized at the
rate expectd, the company added "we believe that the slowness
in orders reflects current conditions in the market for
research instrumentation in Europe."
    It said sales in the current quarter are also being
affected by the previously announced delay in completion of the
software for the Model 900A Data Analysis Module. The
unavialability of that product also impacts sales of the
associated model 420A Derivatizer system.
    Applied Biosystems said it presently expects this software
will be completed during the fourth quarter, but the resulting
lack of demonstration units in the field may postpone some
sales.
    Due to the delays and European uncertainties, "we must now
view the coming quarters with caution," it said, adding "some
earnings pressure is anticipated during the remainder of this
fiscal year."

<TITLE>OUTOKUMPU TO CLOSE NICKEL REFINERY DURING SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Finnish metal and mining group
Outokumpu Oy said it will close its nickel refinery at
Harjavalta in central Finland for six weeks in July and August
this year due to current low prices on the nickel market.
    "We consider nickel prices as bad at the moment, although
they have been rising slightly since January," refinery sales
manager Pekka Purra said.
    He said the closure will mean a drop in production of 3,000
tonnes in 1987 from last years output of 17,800 tonnes. The
closure was also a move to cut labour costs as no extra staff
have to be employed during holidays to keep the plant open.

<TITLE>U.S. FEB INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE 0.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. industrial production rose 0.5
pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January,
the Federal Reserve Board said.
    The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct
in January.
    The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp
rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both
consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production
stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up
1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said.
    The Fed also revised the December industrial production
figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.
    Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1
pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in
durables and 0.1 pct in nondurables, the Fed said.
    Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level.
    Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3
mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units.
    Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct
in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in
February after falling by 2.0 pct in January.
    Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February,
reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and
a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed
said.
    Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in
January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct
rise in January.
    Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, the
same as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago.
    Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in February
after a 1.5 pct January rise.
    Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout
much of 1986. The recent strength in materials has been
concentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said.
    Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fed
said production of items like appliances and furniture
continued strong last month.

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD ltCAW> REJECTS SOSNOFFS OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc said its board
unanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New
York investor Martin T. Sosnoff.
    Caesars said Sosnoffs offer to by all its outstanding
shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best
interests of its shareholders.
    The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoffs
offer, made through his ltMTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender
any of their shares.
    Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative
transactions but did not elaborate.
    Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.
    A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment
further on its decision.
    On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the companys stock.
    Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to
buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
    No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately
available for comment.
    Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc, had determined that Sosnoffs offer was financially
inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.
    The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
Sosnoffs bid was conditioned.
    Caesars stock opened up 1/8 point at 281/8. That is 1/8
point above Sosnoffs offer price.

<TITLE>DUTCH PORT UNION CALLS OFF GENERAL CARGO STRIKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch port and transport union, FNV,
has called off the strikes against planned redundancies that
have hit Rotterdam ports general cargo sector for the past
eight weeks, strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a mass
meeting.
    The decision followed yesterdays ruling by an Amsterdam
court preventing the sectors employers continuing with current
plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again
on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo
sectors 4,000 workers today.
    The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the
complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission
for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.
    "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now
the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,"
Rosenmuller said.
    But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in
protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could
resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves
to reapply for permission for the redundancies.
    SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they
would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to reapplying
for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval
for the redundancies within a month.

said it discontinued operations of its mobile communication

    Howard Lassler, president, said the company intends to

telephone systems division, and on developing new projects for
its mutual signal corp subsidiary.
    The company said dropping retail prices resulted in the

<TITLE>UGANDA REROUTES COFFEE EXPORTS THROUGH KISUMU</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Long delays at the railway crossing on
the Kenyan border have led Uganda to reroute its coffee
exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu
across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.
    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of
Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade
but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.
    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to
three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways
official said. "Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade
and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu," he said.
    However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which
plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing
bottlenecks on the lake route too.
    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported
delays in coffee export shipments last January due to
congestion on the lake ferries.
    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Ugandas export
earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered
all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid
the higher costs of road haulage.

<TITLE>LITTLE JOY FOR SWISS EXPORTERS, STUDY SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The continued strength of the Swiss franc
against the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of the
benefits of the upturn in the world economy, a quarterly study
by the Economics Department said.
    It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost from
the upturn in the economies of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development OECD, and predicted declines in
new orders for highly exportorientated firms.
    However, domestic demand, which stagnated in the last
quarter of 1986, would resume its growth, fuelled by higher
real incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment, it said.
    The study, which was drawn up by the departments
Commission for Economic Questions, said industrial production
would scarcely increase, with most firms apparently happy with
current numbers of workers.
    However, an increase in labour demand in the service sector
should help push up total employment, it said.
    The Commission also predicted an increase in inflation from
current low levels.

<TITLE>CME BOARD LIMITS BUT DOES NOT BAN DUAL TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchanges CME
board of directors issued a letter to its members that sets
limits, but does not ban, dual trading in the S and P 500
futures and options pit.
    The rules prohibit brokers who execute customer orders to 
trade for their own account, or engage in dual trading, from
the top step of the pit  which the board defines as a
geographically advantageous position in the pit.
    Brokers who engage in dual trading in other areas of the
pit must record to the nearest minute those personal trades.
    The board will also set as yet unspecified percentage
limits on the trades brokers can conduct among "broker groups,"
otherwise known as "trading rings."
    By issuing its own rules, the CMEs board rejected a
petition presented in February by some CME members that sought
to prohibit dual trading of any kind in the S and P 500 pits.
    The full CME membership will vote on the petition, since it
was rejected by the board, by April 13. If the members reject
the petition, the board would be free to implement its rules, a
CME spokesman said. However, the members can vote to adopt the
petition and institute a total ban on dual trading.
    The boards rules on dual trading, if implemented, would
prohibit brokers from trading for their own account once they
have executed a customer order from the top step of the pit.
    "Its a step in the right direction," said stock futures
analysts William Marcus of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Inc.
    "Its very difficult to engage in large broker business
from anywhere but the top step," he said.
    "If there were abuses, the rules should act to curb
them," Marcus added.
    The spokesman for the CME said the tenor of the board of
directors letter to members appears to leave open the
possibility of additional limits on dual trading. In addition,
the limits set forth so far will have to be more closely
defined.

<TITLE>ALUSUISSE PLANS 50 PCT CAPITAL CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse,
plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by
50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from
the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on
its financial resources had been stopped, but after
extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986
was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.
    The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it
necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.
    However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through
a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs
of credit into a subordinated loan.
    Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich
stock exchange after todays announcement by the company that
it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said.
Trading would resume again on Monday.

<TITLE>CITICORP ltCCI> DENIES RUMORS OF DEBT WRITEDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Citicorp denied financial market
rumors that it has written off some of its loans to Latin
American debtors,
    "Rumors that we have written off any of our Latin American
debt are unfounded," a Citicorp spokesman told Reuters in
response to Londonbased rumors in the money markets.
    Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one of
the biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to nine
billion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bank
analysts said.
    In response to more specific market rumors that it had
taken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it made
an 8K filing on the subject with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statement
for a preferred stock issue.
    Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazils recent
suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt and related actions "may require Citicorp
to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and longterm
Brazilian loans on a cash basis."
    When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or
principal payments are only booked when received instead of
being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.
    However, Citicorp said in the 8K filing that "it is
premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the
fluidity of the situation and managements high confidence in
the longterm outlook for Brazil."
    Brazils new central bank governor Francisco Gros met
senior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp said
formal talks on Brazils recent actions and future financing
needs should begin in "the near future".
    Citicorp said in the filing, "the issue will be
reevaluated at the end of the first quarter."
    The bank group continued, "if it is decided that these
loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorp
estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in
the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax
and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after
tax."
    It added that these amounts include interest accrued in
1986 that has not yet been collected.
    Although Citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan
writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its
Brazilian loans on nonaccrual unnerved many Wall Street
investors.
    The common stock price was down one dlr to 511/8 after the
first hour on a volume of over 500,000 shares.
    However, Lawrence Cohn, analyst at Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc, said that the markets nervousness was not really
warranted.
    "Citicorp can afford it," he said. "The amounts they are
talking about are peanuts."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The European Monetary System marks its
eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit Ecu, has
been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
Europes common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
when Belgium minted the worlds first Ecu coin.
    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the systems
founding fathers, exWest German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
former French President Valery Giscard dEstaing.
    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
after the EMS was set up, decisionmaking was to have been
transferred from national governments and central banks to an
autonomous European Monetary Fund.
   But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is
that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one
economist who has closely watched the systems development.
    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
systems greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE
    As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against
EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as
West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several
EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow
the marks rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease
financial and trade strains within the community.
    Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued
by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct
against other currencies in the system  the French franc,
Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.
   Another frustration has been Britains failure to lend the
EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
currency, outside the system.
    No change in the British governments attitude is expected
before the countrys next general elections, due by mid1988.
    Meanwhile, the systems last realignment, the 11th since it
was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the ECs
highlysecretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
about the chances for any fundamental change.
    "Technical measures wont be enough to protect the EMS
against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo
de Corel of Kredietbanks economic research department.
    Economists say the systems fortunes now will depend
largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
predict.

<TITLE>GENERAL MILLSltGIS> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>General Mills Inc, reporting
stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said
it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
    The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per
share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It
said this should be achieved despite expected nonoperating
charges in the final quarter.
    General Mills said these charges will likely offset
nonoperating gains, which included six cts a share in the
first half.
    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,
or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a
year ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion
dlrs. Yearago data reflect a twoforone common stock split.

<TITLE>HAITI ANNOUNCES FIND OF ORERICH GOLD FIELD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PORTAUPRINCE, Haiti, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The  Ministry of Mines
has announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois
in Haitis mineralrich North.
    At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman
reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore,
with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The
spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find,
discovered on Wednesday, was worth.
    However, mining could only begin after foreign partners
invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the
spokesman said.
    The Haitian government has never before operated a gold
mine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three
year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa
as sites of important gold deposits.
    In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a
Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate
containing gold as well as copper.
    "The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,"
said a former official of Sedren Mine.
    "But like everything else theres a catch. The gold has to
be extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money
to finance the operation," the official, who asked not to be
named, told Reuters.

<TITLE>U.S. FIRMS LOBBY FOR DUTCH HELICOPTER ORDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A delegation from McDonnellDouglas
Corp ltMD.N> will visit the Dutch parliament on Monday in an
attempt to win a 2.5billion guilder helicopter order, a
Defence Ministry spokesman said.
    U.S. Helicopter manufacturer ltSikorsky> approached Dutch
parliamentarians and army officials last month, he added.
    The Dutch seek 50 new army helicopters over a 10year
period and plan to replace Lynx navy helicopters before the
year 2000.
    The first batch of 20 helicopters has to be operative in
1990, while the next 30 will be introduced gradually in the
following years, spokesman Cent van Vliet said.
    The U.S. Visit come as the Dutch have already narrowed down
their options to the Mongoose of Italian producer ltAgusta Spa>
and the Panther of French firm ltAerospatiale>, Van Vliet said.
    The Dutch had not considered U.S. Helicopters, he said,
adding the Ministry planned to present its choice to parliament
in May.
    European models rejected include the Lynx III of British
manufacturer ltWestland>. A parliamentary accounting watchdog
this week blasted the performance of 22 older versions of the
Lynx currently used by the navy, saying they were hardly up to
their job.

<TITLE>NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations on a new International
Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the
makeorbreak point and prospects for a future pact appear to
be in the balance, delegates said.
    Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA
renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small
group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major
outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said
those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to
allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.
    The talks are due to last until March 20.
    Xuto said, "There is nothing concrete yet, but the
atmosphere is good." The discussions are expected to continue
late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend
meetings.
    Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to
which price adjustments should be automatic.
    At present, if the market price has been above or below the
reference price set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo
in the current agreement for six months, the reference price
is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the
International Natural Rubber Organisation council.
    Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the
adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.
    Producers want the council to have the last word and have
resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.
    Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling
another issue  that of the floor price.
    It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their
insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called
the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances.
    This means that any possible compromise would centre on the
reference price, and the "may buy" or "may sell" and "must buy" or
"must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price"
 which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current
pact.
    Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on
the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to
another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews  at
12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

<DATELINE>   KANSAS CITY, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union is rumored
this morning to have bought up to 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn,
export trade sources said.
    The amount was not confirmed, but the talk was widespread
through the trade. Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to
three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to
boost futures prices on todays open.
    The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of
U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade
talks with U.S. agriculture officials.
    Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in
light of a Soviet trade officials statement that the previous
purchase had satisfied nearterm needs.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN RAILWAY ISSUES DOMESTIC STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The West German federal railway is
raising 900 mln marks through a 10year loan stock on the
domestic market with a coupon of 61/4 pct and price of par, a
Bundesbank spokesman said in response to enquiries.
    Some 750 mln marks will be offered for immediate sale with
75 mln held back for market regulation and the remaining 75 mln
placed with the railways own bank.
    The stock will be offered for sale between March 17 and 19
and will be listed on all German stock exchanges from March 20
to 24. The stock pays annual interest on April 1.
    Terms of the bond conformed with those expected earlier
today, dealers said.
    The bond rose in the first hour of grey market trading to
less 7/8, less 5/8, after being quoted at less 11/8, less 7/8
in first business.
    Dealers said demand rose owing to the bonds relatively
small size.
    In contrast, the last railway issue in January totalled 1.1
billion marks, of which 900 mln was distributed for immediate
sale.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANK SEES GOOD SOVIET TRADE PROSPECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>SovietWest German trade is expected
to develop favourably due to Moscows increasing openness to
EastWest economic relations, Dresdner Bank AGs Moscow
representative Michael Stein said.
    He told a bank presentation the Soviet Union was last year
hit by the fall in world oil prices, which cut export revenue
from oilrelated products and natural gas, and its overseas
buying power was also adversely affected by the lower dollar.
   Dresdner Bank economist Alfred Apholte said the Soviet
Unions large currency and gold reserves had softened the
impact of the dollar weakening and oil price drop.

<TITLE>BENEFICIAL ltBNL> DOWNGRADED BY MOODYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Moodys Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded 3.4 billion dlrs of debt of Beneficial Corp.
    Cut to Baa2 from Baa1 were the senior debt of the company
and the guaranteed debt of its unit, Beneficial Overseas
Finance NV.
    Also downgraded were Beneficials shelf registrations of
senior debt to Provisional Baa2 from Provisional Baa1 and of
subordinated debt to Provisional Ba1 from Provisional Baa3.
    Moodys said the magnitude of Beneficials 1986 operating
losses from writedowns of discontinued businesses has weakened
its financial position.
    "The costs of meeting the potential liability for insurance
losses to facilitate the sale of the companys insurance unit
and of revaluing other discontinued business segments have
substantially exceeded original indications," Moodys said in a
release.
    The agency said Beneficials consumer finance business
remains strong and has the capacity to withstand foreseeable
adverse developments.
    But the withdrawal from nontraditional businesses is
weakening consolidated leverage, narrowing funding operations
and depressing the quality of earnings, Moodys stressed.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The ltNew York Stock Exchange> said it
and its ltNew York Futures Exchange> affiliate will move the
expiration of their respective index options and index futures
contracts to the opening of trading in the underlying stock on
expiration Friday from the close of trading.
    The exchange said it has submitted the changes to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission for approval.
    The exchange said, "The NYSE has long advocated settlement
in the morning rather than at the close of trading as a
practical way to deal with order imbalances and price
volatility which historically occur on triple witching days."
    The "triple witching hour" falls four times a year when
stock options, index options and futures on index options all
expire on the third Friday of every month, leading to major
lasthour market swings.  On the last triple witching Friday,
December 19, the NYSE traded almost 85 mln shares at the close
of the market.  The next triple witching hour will take place
Friday March 20.
    The exchange said, "Morning settlement would expose order
imbalances to the full sunlight of public disclosure, ensure
the broadest dissemination of market information and facilitate
the participation of all interested investors."

<TITLE>ITALIAN BUSINESS CONCERNED OVER POLITICAL CRISIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Italian Prime Minister designate Giulio
Andreotti expressed cautious optimism about his chances of
forming a government, amid concern by industrialists that a
lengthy political crisis could cause economic damage.
    Andreotti today wound up his first round of political
consultations aimed at finding a way out of the crisis.
    His Christian Democrats and the Socialists of outgoing
premier Bettino Craxi, whose row caused last weeks collapse of
the fiveparty coalition, remained deeply divided.
    Andreotti said he would spend the weekend considering the
situation before a second round of consultations next week.
    Meanwhile Italys top industrialists expressed concern that
a long drawnout crisis, or continuing squabbling between the
five coalition partners, could jeopardise the major economic
progress made in threeandahalf stable years under Craxi.
    Luigi Lucchini, president of the employers organisation
Confindustria said in a speech yesterday, "What is certain is
that a precarious political situation is damaging to the
economy, to the objectives of companies, to competitivity."
    His remarks were supported by Fiat chairman Giovanni
Agnelli, who said in a radio interview that he hoped for a
reconstruction of the coalition.

<TITLE>SOUTHDOWN ltSDW> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Moodys Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded to Ba2 from Baa3 Southdown Incs 140 mln dlrs of
senior debt.
    The agency also assigned an initial rating of B1 to the
companys 90 mln dlrs of senior subordinated notes due 1997.
    Moodys said the action reflected increased leverage and
reduced interest resulting from lower earnings. It also cited
Southdowns repurchase of 28 pct of its common stock and the
financing of that transaction by debt.
    Moodys said the lower ratings anticipate certain debt
reduction in the coming year from the sale of assets.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Proposals for a secondary market for
the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage
markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders
and could be established this year, Congressional and financial
sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration
FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association GNMA and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac, industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasigovernment farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
highquality loans on farmland to "poolers" who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgagebacked securities for
resale to investors called Aggiemae by some supporters.
    However, the FCA and financiallytroubled farm credit
system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea.
    The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market
established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit
system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. That
could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6
billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system
officials have said.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes the farm credit systems market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The
study was released earlier today.

<TITLE>SALOMON INC ltSB> SAID TO CUT U.S. BANKS RATINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Inc has lowered its investment
ratings on all U.S. money center banks, institutional sources
said.
    The sources said Salomon believes that other money center
banks may feel compelled to follow Citicorps ltCCI> lead
in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to its loan exposure to Brazil.
    They also said Salomon believes that other banks may
strongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans on
a nonaccruing status with the consequent negative impact on
earnings.
    The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from Oplus.
The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poors 500
Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.
    The sources said it is also understood that the change in
the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a
sellrecommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its
downgrading will only prove temporary.
    The banks affected by the change in investment coding are
Bank of New York Co Inc ltBK>, Bankers Trust Co ltBT>, Chase
Manhattan Corp ltCMB>, Chemical New York Corp ltCHL>, Citicorp
ltCCI>, Irving Bank Corp ltV>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp ltMHC>,
J.P. Morgan and Co Inc ltJPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc ltMM>,
Republic New York Corp ltRNB>, Bank of Boston Corp ltBKB> and
First Chicago Corp ltFNB>.
    The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley, a
director of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is in
charge of bank stock research, believes Citicorps move is
welltimed.
    Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in a
nonperforming category at the end of this quarter this action
would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt
negotiations, he argues.
    Thus Citicorps bargaining position would appear to have
been much enhanced.

<TITLE>FRN PANIC INITIATED, EXACERBATED BY MARKET MAKERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen and Dominique Jackson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Todays panic in the floating rate note
market has been simmering for months and is, in many ways, of
the market makers own doing, traders and bank officials said.
    "For the last six months, there have been a series of crises
in the FRN market. Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very
fibre of the market," said a senior official at a U.S. Bank.
    As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters who
originally brought the issues have retreated. They have
divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible,
unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic
trading.
    In the virtual effective closure of the market for
perpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed the
consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and
investor confidence.
    Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis
infecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which is
almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with an
estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    "The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory
that they will sell at any price," said an official at a leading
U.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices
down sharply over the last two days.
    Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that todays trading was
unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and
that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities
they sold.
    In highlighting this point, dealers noted that the
benchmark issues in the FRN market  the two FRNs for the
U.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986  fell an unprecedented 50 and
40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning.
    Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less creditworthy
today than it was yesterday and the countrys economic health
currently appears better than it has for some time.
    Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supranational
debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRN
source said "The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the
fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated
loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay."
    Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutes
a significant part of the market, was currently under pressure.
    Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks eased
markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor
fears about the banks exposure to Latin American debt.
    The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along with
Republic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week with
dealers citing one heavilytraded Citicorp note falling to
levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points
over Libor the London Interbank Offered Rate.
    By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998
yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid the London
Interbank Bid Rate when it was issued in January last year.
    Price declines of this size can really only be explained by
an understanding of the operating practices of leading players
in the market, dealers and banking analysts said.
    "This has to be understood as a matter between banks who
have a brief to buy low and sell high," one U.S. Bank source
noted.
    Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to the
enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the
last few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified.
    But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk,
dealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold.
    Although sophisticated onscreen dealing exists in most
markets, in the euromarkets trading is conducted by telephone.
    "If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price
in any issue, and you do, he can say "Right. You own five mln,"
a trader said, explaining market practice.
    The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the
securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even
lower price, the trader explained.
    It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid
downward price spiral earlier today, traders said, adding that
it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their
confidence or market practices change.
    One possible solution, dealers said, would be to initiate
trading exclusively through brokers screens, so that only
those who wanted to buy bonds would have to "lift a bid" or buy
at that price.
    Meanwhile, bank regulators are apparently concerned about
the implications of the collapse in FRN prices.
    Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called
around to market makers asking whether they intended to
continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be.
    The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market, but
dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific.
    A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment
immediately on the Banks action.
    One trader at a major U.S. Bank here said that in addition,
the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks international capital
markets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking
information about trading in FRNs. He also said that this was
not an unusual procedure.

<TITLE>NYSE, NYFE MOVE INDEX FUTURES/OPTIONS EXPIRATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Stock Exchange said it
and its New York Futures Exchange affiliate will move the
expiration of their respective index options and index futures
contracts to the opening of trading in the underlying stock on
each expiration Friday from the close of trading.
    The exchange said it has submitted the changes to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission for approval.
    The exchange said, "The NYSE has long advocated settlement
in the morning rather than at the close of trading as a
practical way to deal with order imbalances and price
volatility which historically occur on socalled "triple
witching days."
    The triple witching hour falls four times a year when
individual stock options, stock index futures and options on
stock indexes all expire on the third Friday of the month,
which has led to volatile lasthour market swings.
    On the last triple witching Friday, December 19, the NYSE
traded almost 85 mln shares at the close of the market. The
next triple witching hour will take place Friday, March 20.
    The exchange said, "Morning settlement would expose order
imbalances to the full sunlight of public disclosure, ensure
the broadest dissemination of market information, and
facilitate the participation of all interested investors."

<TITLE>PETROBRAS ASKS ARMY TO WITHDRAW TROOPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils stateoil company
Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were
occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said
in a statement.
    The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the
troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its
refineries.
    "The request was also due to the end of the seamens strike
and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by
the negotiating table," the statement said.
    Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamens
strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping
companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming
majority of Brazils seamen remained on strike.
    The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil
industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the
presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.
    Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops
was made at 1100 local hours 1400 GMT, but a company
spokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been
removed.

that said former Mobil Corp president William Tavoulareas set

<TITLE>PROPOSALS TO RELAX U.S. DRUG LAWS POSE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marjorie Shaffer, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan Administrations soontobe
published proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidly
and widely available to terminally ill patients pose product
liability problems for drug companies, experts in the
pharmaceutical field said.
    Details of the proposals will be published in the Federal
Register shortly and will become effective after a 90day
comment period.
    Under the proposed policy, announced Tuesday by
Commissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E. Young at a press
conference, patients with life threatening diseases who are not
enrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an
experimental therapy. The policy also allows drug companies to
sell the promising drugs to patients.
    Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use
freeofcharge if the agent was shown to be effective. Under
the new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician
to administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be
unsafe.
    Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit
biotechnology companies with few or no products approved for
marketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact on
large drug companies with many other sources of revenue.
    "Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help
biotech companies nearterm financial situation and help make
them less dependent on outside sources," said Teena Lerner, a
biotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild.
    Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be
put into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have
devastating side effects.
    "Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they
are going to have to think long and hard about liabilitythe
product liability problems are enormous," said a
Washingtonbased lawyer who specializes in the drug field.
    Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed
consent papers before taking an investigational drug. The
lawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits
against a drug companys investigational drug.
    "The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish," said
the lawyer. "Drug companies are right now probably meeting with
their insurance companies."
    BurroughsWellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firm
Wellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc ltMRK>,
HoffmanLaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp ltSKB> said it
was too soon to comment on the policy.
    "Im very uncomforable with this," said Wellcome
spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett. "We havent had a chance to
formulate a response yet. Its too early."
    But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefit
drug companies.
    "I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration of
the FDAs past policies that should positively affect drug
companies stocks," said drug analyst Davis Saks, with Morgan,
Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner.
    Saks also warned that many health care providers would balk
at the proposal, and would call it "amoral" to charge patients
with lifethreatening diseases for drugs that otherwise would
be given out for free in clinical trials.
    Jeffrey Warren, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, which represents the major drug
firms in the U.S., said "A mechanism already exists at the FDA
permitting certain seriously ill patients access to
experimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved."
    Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come up
with a consensus among its membership when the rules are
formally published.
    He also admitted that product liability problems could be a
concern to major drug companies.
    Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, which is actively in AIDS policy and
funding issues, cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG ltBAYRY>,
which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment, but on
wider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects.

<TITLE>SWISS WARY OF U.S.BRITISH BANK SUPERVISION PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Markus Lusser, vicepresident of the
Swiss National Bank, said he was sceptical of the recent
U.S.British accord on joint bank supervision, fearing smaller
countries could be forced to cooperate.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to a meeting of West
German savings banks, he said such an accord would cover the
three most important financial centres of the world if extended
to Japan as planned.
    "Countries not prepared to cooperate with an agreement of
the group of three could easily be put under pressure," Lusser
said.
    "It would be enough to forbid banks the right to make use of
those financial markets or to place them under a special
status," he added.
    Banks which operate worldwide could scarcely afford to stay
away from these centres and would place their national
governments under pressure to conform.
    Lusser added that he was opposed to the form, though not
the content of the accord. Switzerland itself was not affected,
since capital adequacy requirements here were already stricter
than in Britain or the United States. But he feared such
accords might be substituted for internationally negotiated
pacts.

<TITLE>GERMAN SECURITIES MAY BE COUNTED IN LENDING RATIOS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>West German banking authorities are
considering requiring German banks to bring securities holdings
into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk,
banking sources said.
    The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks
maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital  reserves plus
equity capital  but sets no restraints on securities
holdings.
    Under new provisions, weightings would be attached to
securities similar to those used for lending. Weightings would
range from a zero rating for norisk assets to 100 pct of total
asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk.
    Lowrisk securities carrying a zero rating would include
public authority bonds for the federal government, states and
municipalities, the sources said.
    A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic
banks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority
banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as
mortgage and municipal bonds.
    Securities issued by foreign banks would attract a
weighting of 50 pct, while authorities are considering
requiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assets
of foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers.
    The sources said the revision is still being discussed, and
required approval by the federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin, the Bundesbank, and West Germanys four banking
associations.
    The move is a response to the increasing securitisation of
debt markets, they added.

<TITLE>PROGRESS IN IRAN LOAN TALKS, FRENCH OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Talks between France and Iran on the
repayment of a one billion dlr loan by the late Shah have made
progress, Roland Dumas, head of a parliamentary Foreign Affairs
Committee said.
    "They are progressing as far as I have heard," Dumas told
reporters. "The two delegations appear to be near an agreement
on the figures."
    Dumas, a close aide to President Francois Mitterrand,
earlier this week met Iranian Charge dAffaires in Paris
Haddadi Gholamreza.
    The report of progress contrasts with official French
statements last month after talks between Deputy Iranian
Finance Minister Mehdi Navvab and the French Finance Ministry.
    The talks, the latest round in longrunning negotiations
between the two countries, were said to have led to little
progress on the loan repayment issue.
    France made a first repayment of 330 mln dlrs last
November. Since then negotiatiors have shuttled between Tehran
and Paris for talks which France hopes will help secure freedom
for hostages held by proIranian groups in Lebanon.
    Iran is claiming full repayment of principal and interest
on the Shahs loan, made in 1975 to the EURODIF uranium
enrichment consortium. It has also asked France to curb the
activities of Iranian dissidents in France and stop selling
weapons to Iraq, its enemy in the Gulf War.
    France for its part has made a counter claim for more than
500 mln dlrs in compensation for contracts with French firms
broken after the 1979 revolution.

    The change affects 515 mln dlrs in debt and assumes a

    Hughes senior debt was raised to DP8 from DP12 middle
BB while subordinated debt was raised to DP9 middle BBB
from DP14 high B.
    The debt ratio of the combined compaies will be about 40

<TITLE>ZENITH ltZEN> GETS APPROVAL FOR GENERIC KEFLEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RAMSEY, New Jersey, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Zenith Laboratories Inc said
it received Food and Drug Administration approval to market
Cephalexin, an antibiotic that is the generic version of Eli
Lilly Incs ltLLY> Keflex.
    Generic drugs are lowcost copies of brand name drugs that
have lost their patents. Keflexs patent expires April 21.
Analysts said four generic drug companies, including Zenith,
will have approval to market generic Keflex this year.
    Analysts said Keflex is Lillys second leading drug
product, with 1986 worldwide sales of about 335 mln dlrs. In
1986 Lilly had sales of 3.7 billion dlrs.
    "We think that in the first year that it loses its patent,
U.S. sales of Keflex will drop to about 240 mln dlrs from 280
mln dlrs," said Joe Riccardo, associate director of Bear
Stearns.
    Riccardo said Lilly would offset the loss with sales from
Humatrope, a genetically engineered human growth hormone
recently approved for marketing in the U.S.
    He also said it was likely that Lilly would get U.S. FDA
marketing approval this year for Prozac, a drug for treating
clinical depression that also shows promise in weight
reduction.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/DOME PETROLEUM ltDMP></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltds revised debt
restructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves its
appeal as a takeover target, but full debt repayment depends on
a sharp oil price rise, oil and banking analysts said.
    Domes complex proposal to let creditors link some or all
of their debt to oilindexed debentures or convert it to equity
is "very cut and dried and to the point," Peters and Co Ltd
Calgarybased energy analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Dome "is saying, This is the way it is. There isnt enough
money to pay you back," he added.
    The plan "strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do,"
First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented.
    He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments to
creditors with the price of oil, which governs Domes cash flow
and ability to service its debt.
    Dome expects its total debt to reach 6.4 billion Canadian
dlrs by June 30, 1987, when an interim debt rescheduling plan
expires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan.
    Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecured
creditors in a complex series of repayment categories or "an
agreed pecking order of what your creditors claim to assets
is."
    Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow under
the debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolve
competing claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and on
remaining unpledged assets, Gobert and others said.
    "Certainly the restructuring plan, once its agreed to and
put in place, is going to make it easier for someone to come in
and look at doing a deal on it acquiring the company," Gobert
remarked.
    "Its going to be a lot easier than it is right now because
youll have settled the pecking order question," he added.
    Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by a
desire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole.
    "If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans they
could do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of the
company, as opposed to dismemberment," he said.
    Domes proposal includes rescheduling secured debt payments
over a 15 to 20 year schedule, linking payments to cash flows
generated by assets pledged against loans and establishing
interest rates that allow for changing oil prices.
    Creditors only real alternative to Domes plan is "an
asset grab which would liquidate the company at distress
prices, and the banks would spend the next 20 years in court
deciding who had what asset," First Marathons Doak said.
    For Domes creditors, the plan does not offer a quick
method to recover loans, but extends payment time in the hope
that oil prices will rise, increasing the amount of the
companys debt payments, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analyst
Terry Shaunessy said.
    The plan "is not a solution. It says give me more time and
lets keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up."
    Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to rise
to about 28 to 30 U.S. dlrs a barrel to fully service all of
the companys debt.
    Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continues
to operate, but provides little other benefit to common
shareholders.
    "From a common shareholder standpoint, all this does is
sort of keep him on the life support system, because there
isnt any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices,"
Gobert remarked.
    Analysts said Domes common shares, trading today at 1.12
dlrs, off four cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices.
    "You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oil
in the context of historical trends before theres any residual
value for the common shareholders," analyst Doak said.
    While Domes plan said lenders will be able to convert debt
to common shares, the amount of dilution depends on share
conversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenders
would choose to convert, the company said.

<TITLE>YEUTTER SAYS DLR LEVEL BASED ON ECONOMIC POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would
fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations
financial, monetary and tax policies.
    But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the Heritage
Foundation, that in the end "the marketplace will ultimately
rule the day."
    Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether
or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and
coooperation among trading nations.
    Yeutter said "if nations do the right kinds of things in
financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of
adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision
a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer
to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange
rates becoming relatively stable."
    But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not
exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation,
"It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that
adjustment."

<TITLE>PAINT COMPANY HAS METEXltMTX> STAKE, MAY BUY MORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Metropolitan Consolidated Industries
Inc, a New York paint company, said it has acquired 278,709
shares of Metex Corp, or 21.2 pct of the total, and left open
the possibility that it might acquire more through a merger.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Metropolitan said it bought the Metex stock as an investment.
    It also said it may buy additional shares, or sell some or
all of its current stake. If it buys more shares, Metropolitan
said it would consider doing so in the open market, in private
deals, or through an exchange offer, tender offer or merger.
    Metropolitan said it may acquire an option on or may buy
some or all of the Metex shares owned by William Hack, a Metex
director, who, together with this wife, holds 149,750 of the
companys common shares, or 11.4 pct of the total.
    Metropolitan said it already has an option to buy another
42,750 Metex common shares at 11.25 dlrs each. The option is
not exercisable until April 12, 1988, it said.
    If Metropolitan were to exercise the option and acquire all
of Hacks stake, it would have 471,208 Metex common shares, or
35.9 pct of the total. Metropolitans SEC filing was
made as a shareholder group with Hack.
    Metropolitan, which said it spent 3.1 mln dlrs to acquire
its Metex stake, listed its recent stock purchases as 54,993
common shares on March 67 at 10 dlrs each and 83,916 shares on
March 11 at 11.25 dlrs.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE SAID HOLDING OFF DECISION ON BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Washington, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional budget leaders are
asking President Reagan to join in a bipartisan effort  or
even a summit  to write a new budget, but White House chief of
staff Howard Baker said no decision has been made yet, a Senate
source said.
    The request for White House cooperation was made yesterday
by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles at a meeting
with Baker, the source said.
    The appeal came as the Senate Budget Committee made plans
to start drafting next Tuesday a fiscal 1988 budget plan that
Democrats controlling Congress hope to get through both
chambers by April 15.
    House Democrats have been meeting privately and will
continue discussions on Tuesday to develop a plan for the full
committee which holds its first drafting meeting Thursday.
    Reagans own budget was submitted in January but Congress
generally has rejected it as unrealistic, with the
Congressional Budget Office saying the deficit is understated
and should be a more realistic 134 billion dlrs.   
    Among major controversial decisions that Congress has to
make are levels of deficit deductions to meet the GrammRudman
budget law target of cutting the estimated 171
billion dlr deficit for 1988 to 108 billion dlrs.
    A key decisions is the amount of new revenues  Reagan
proposed some 22 billion dlrs in asset sales and excise taxes 
as part of a deficit cutting plan.
    Reagan, who opposes new taxes, refuses to say he is
advocating higher taxes through his revenue scheme.
    The GrammRudman law sets fixed deficit targets for
Congress with the aim of wiping out huge deficits by 1991, but
over the past two years deficits have exceeded the targets.
    The Senate source said that Chiles asked for cooperation to
avoid clashes when the Senate and House Budget committees start
writing separate budget plans for congressional approval,
starting next week.
    The source said Chiles told Baker "If you start working
sooner, rather than later you have a chance to do something
before everyone gets locked in."
    Baker has had conversations about the budget problem with
Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, and with House Speaker Jim Wright.
    Baker reportedly said that he plans to have further talks
with other Republicans and House Budget Committee Chairman
William Gray "before the the White House decides what it is
going to do, if anything," the source said.
    House sources said that Gray who has been pushing the
idea of a budget summit with Reaganis anxious to work with
the White House to get a compromise budget plan.
    Besides reaching decisions on actual spending and revenue
levels in a new budget, congressmen are considering adjusting
or redefining the targets of the GrammRudman law to make them
more realistic.
    Reagan presented about 36 billion dlrs in spending delays,
cuts and revenues he said will reach 108 billion dlrs.
    Gray has said that if Congress approves 36 billion dlrs in
reductions, the deficit would be 134 billion dlrs realistically
because of what he says are more accurate economic assumptions.

<TITLE>BALLY ltBLY> CONSIDERING SALE OF SIX FLAGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is
considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit
and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
    In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
    "Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,"
Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
were it to be sold, to repay debt.
    Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
said. The health club chain, the nations largest, is valued at
350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
    Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
Flags by several prospective buyers.
    The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
dlrs mountain of debt.
    Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
Inc ltGNG.N>.
    The purchase pushed its longterm debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
    Ballys 325unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Ballys
total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
    Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
Marriott Corp ltmhs>.
    In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
    The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
    The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
estate developer Donald Trump.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
    The deal also requires Bally to buy Trumps remaining
shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
that level by February 21, 1988.

<TITLE>USSR LIVESTOCK MAY BE IN GOOD SHAPEU.S. REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet livestock herds are possibly
in better shape than expected after the recent harsh winter,
the U.S. agriculture counselor in Moscow said.
    Livestock procurement levels for January and February were
recently reported in a Soviet agriculture newspaper to be up
five pct from year ago levels, an attache report said.
    "These procurement levels ... are surprisingly normal given
the harshness of the 1986/87 winter ... indicating neither
abnormal distress slaughter nor subnormal livestock product
output. While the overwintering period is not over yet, the
worst of it is, and herds are possibly in better shape than
expected," the counselor said.
    A healthy livestock sector will keep Soviet feed demand 
strong and impact USSR grain imports, analysts said.
    January livestock procurement levels were up only 1.6 pct,
indicating a turn around in February, an Agriculture Department
analyst of the Soviet Union said.
    The analyst said an easing of the cold weather in February,
coupled with heavy amounts of grain fed to the animals would
account for the rise in procurements.
    "Theres no question that the Soviet livestock is in good
shape," he said.

<TITLE>CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Cuban sugar export figures for January
suggest that this years crop may be at least as large as last
years 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.
    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up
from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by
the International Sugar Organization.
    January is the first major export month and the figures
thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.
Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000
tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking
at the end of 1985, they added.
    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
year at 7.50 mln tonnes.
    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln
tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.
    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but
a hurricane meant that last years crop was extended.
    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon
countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the
same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.
    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took
substantially more Cuban sugar.
    Cubas November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and Decembers total was
237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.
Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln
tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985  the lowest level since
1980s 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

<TITLE>MIDLAND UNIT PULLS OUT OF EQUITY MARKET MAKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Midland Bank Plc ltMDBL.L> said its
Greenwell Montagu Securities unit would pull out of equity
market making and concentrate instead on providing a broker
dealer and agency service for its clients.
    The operation has become the first major casualty in the
London markets since deregulation last October abolished fixed
commissions and allowed the merging of broking and jobbing
operations into market making activities.
    A spokesman said Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged, which is a
primary gilt edged market maker, and Greenwell Montagu
stockbrokers, were not affected by the decision.
    The market making operation had encountered much greater
competition than had been expected in the postBig Bang period,
the spokesman added.
    Although Midland considered that the operation would be
viable in the long term, it would require the concentration of
greater resources than could be justified for an operation that
was not a core Midland activity. He confirmed Greenwell Montagu
Securities had been losing money in past months.
    The pull out from market making would be conducted in an
orderly fashion in the near future. There might also be some
job losses, he said without giving any details.
    Market sources said it was no great surprise that a market
maker had pulled out, as the intensity of competition had
suggested for some time that sooner or later someone would
decide to withdraw.
    They said some retreat by Greenwell had been likely because
of its losses, and added there also been speculation that it
could pull out of market making in gilts also.
    The move was unlikely to have any major impact on market
confidence, as the occasional speculation in the past few weeks
had had little impact.
    Analysts said commission rates on institutional equity
trades have dropped sharply in the five months since
deregulation, with some firms covering some of their reduced
profits by trading on their own account.
    In a recent report, Greenwell Montagu Research said, "Those
who have made profits are either immensely clever or immensely
lucky. Some are already approaching the pain barrier, others
are prepared to tough it out. But until some players withdraw
from the market, it will be difficult to improve profitability."
    Dealers said the pace of withdrawals was likely to speed up
in the next year, and would intensify if the threemonth bull
run on the London stock exchange petered out.

<TITLE>U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP SEEN 10 TO 12 MLN ACRES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Grain traders and analysts look for a
10 to 12 mln acre signup in the USDAs conservation reserve
program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.
    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the
acres submitted, they said.
    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is
only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year
has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.
    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre signup may
end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted
by farmers. Also, acres setaside under the conservation
program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total
corn production will be minimal, they added.

<TITLE>MOBIL ltMOB> LONG TERM DEBT DOWN IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp made a 15 pct reduction in
its long term debt in 1986 from the previous year according to
data in its 1986 annual report.
    Mobil chairman, Allen E. Murray said in his report to
shareholders, "that lower debt and our strong cash and
marketable securities position improves Mobils flexibility."
    Long term debt as of December 31, 1986 was put at 7.9
billion dlrs, down 15 pct from 9.3 billion dlrs on the same day
in 1985.
    Mobil has moved to reduce debt at high interest rates,
which may reduce interest payments.
    Murray said that with the results from 1986, "were paying
back 3.8 billion dlrs in the past two years, or the equivalent
of 66 pct of the debt incurred in 1984 when we bought Superior
Oil."
    Mobil said that it has about 183 mln dlrs of long term debt
which is due in 1987 although this will rise appreciably to 1.2
billion dlrs of long term debt due in 1988.
    At the end of 1986, Mobil said it also had an existing
effective shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commmission to permit the sale of 205 mln dlrs of debt.
   Mobils debt reduction program has also been abetted by
several steps taken by the company to restructure its
operations.
    Mobils Murray said in his remarks to shareholders that the
company was continuing to dispose of assets which did not fit
the companys long range plans and had realized some 1.1
billion dlrs from the sale of its Container Corp subsidiary.
    Murray said that as a result of lower debt and more
efficient operations "the company is now is a position to seize
opportunities that may become available and use this strength
in whatever way best builds shareholder value."

<TITLE>IADB CHIEF WARNS OF EVENTUAL LATIN DEFAULT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of the
InterAmerican Development Bank, warned that if Latin countries
were unable to speed up their economic growth, then in the long
run there would be a default.
    He told a press conference foreshadowing the banks annual
meeting next week, "For the banks it is convenient to be
repaid. But to achieve that, the countries need to grow. If
they dont, then in the long run there will be a default."
    Ortiz Mena warned that Latin America needed to reverse the
capital outflows from the region and beyond that needed more
resources.
    Ortiz Mena declined to agree with estimates that capital
outflows from Latin America last year totaled 35 billion dlrs
and that therefore he was calling for an inflow into the region
above that sum.
    He said the U.S. debt strategy, which envisaged stepped up
lending by commercial and multilateral banks to major debtor
nations of 29 billion dlrs over three years, was insufficient
to achieve the necessary rates of growth.
    But he did stress the U.S. plan was important and the right
approach.
    Ortiz Mena said, "It is in the interest of the creditors,
not only the debtors, to push forward the development process
in Latin America and that has happened."
    He added, "The only problem is the resources have not been
enough."
    Turning to Brazil, whose growth rate he predicted will
decline slightly this year from 1986, Ortiz Mena said the
countrys moratorium was the right action in order to avert a
long term default.
    "So its preferable they negotiate now," a move which would
eliminate any chance of panic in the markets.
    Ortiz Mena also said that Brazilian authorities have opened
negotiations already with commercial banks.
    He pointed out Brazil took the action because of its
deteriorating economic situation.

recalling all lots of its Gynex oral contraceptives.
    The FDA said some of the blisterpack cards that house the
birth contol pills may contain out of sequence tablets in the
28daycycle package. It said other 21daycycle packages may
be missing some tablets.
    If oral contraceptives are taken in the wrong order or
skipped, the likelihood of pregancy increases.
    The FDA said said the recall affects 315,000 packages of
the pills which were distributed nationwide since the drug was
first distributed in February.
    The FDA said Searle believes only a small number of
pacakges, about 2,000 to 3,000, were dispensed to consumers.
    The FDA also said the labeling on the product indicates
that Gynex oral contraceptives are manufactured and packaged by
Corona Pharmaceutical of Corona, Calif., for G.D. Searle and

<TITLE>AMSTERDAM BOURSE SAID DELAYING DREXEL MEMBERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   AMSTERDAM, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Amsterdam Stock Exchange today
declined to comment on a press report saying Drexel Burnham
Lambert Incs request for membership had been delayed pending
investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    The Exchange was replying to Reuters inquiries after the
leading Dutch evening daily NRC Handelsblad published a report
this evening quoting an unnamed bourse official as saying
Drexels application was delayed while the firm was under
investigation by the SEC.
    It usually takes the bourse one to two months to process a
membership application, the official said, adding "Its been
going on for three to four months with Drexel, so draw your own
conclusions."
   "Were not particularly worried about the contents of the
application but we think the timing is somewhat unfortunate,"
the NRC quoted the official as saying.
   Drexel is currently under investigation by the SEC in
connection with insider trading activities by Ivan Boesky and
Dennis Levine last November, a month after the company applied
for permission to deal in Dutch equity.
   An exchange spokesman said there was nothing unusual about
the processing period of Drexels application, adding that he
would not comment on any company before all documents had been
studied by the bourse board.
   A spokesman from Drexels London branch, which is dealing
with the application, said the delay was of a purely technical
nature in Drexels head office in New York.

<TITLE>CME BOARD PLAN SAID NOT ANSWER TO DUAL TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchanges CME board of directors to restrict dual trading by
stockindex futures floor brokers would not provide a solution
to alleged abuses in the market, House Small Business Committee
chief economist John Helmuth said.
    Helmuth worked on legislation offered earlier this week by
Rep. Neil Smith DIowa to ban dual trading in the Standard
and Poors 500 stock index futures trading pit.
    Last night the CME board recommended curbing, but not
banning, dual trading in S and P 500 futures and options.
    The CME board rejected a petition presented in February by
some members seeking an outright ban on dual trading, whereby 
floor brokers trade for their own accounts as well as for
customers.
    Helmuth said the boards proposal would not prevent traders
from falsifying the record that shows the times of their
trades.
    Helmuth predicted Smiths bill would be closely examined by
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. John
Dingell RMichigan. Dingell and his staff were unavailable
for comment.

cut its long term debt to 85 mln dlrs from 100 mln dlrs when
its European bondholders voluntarily converted some of their
debt holdings into 1.5 mln shares of Pegasus common.
    The company said the debt converted represents about 40 pct
of the total 60 mln Swiss franc convertible debentures it
completed last Fall.
    In addition, Pegasus said it began mining and processing
operations at its Zortman/Landusky Mine one month ahead of
schedule.
    Pegasus said it completed the first phase of its 1987 Super
Pad ahead of schedule as well, allowing the mining company to
load up to 7.5 mln tons of new ore on the pad.
    Pegasus estimated that 1987 production at the
Zortman/Landusky mine will be about 80,000 ounces of gold and
225,000 ounces of silver.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A decision by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to remove a key regulatory obstacle to
trading foreign debt futures on U.S. Exchanges was a
constructive development, London International Financial
Futures Exchange LIFFE Chief Executive Michael Jenkins said.
    The SEC yesterday agreed to remove the regulation against
trading futures in designated foreign government debt
securities on markets not located in the issuing country.
    Jenkins said the decision cleared the way for the Chicago
Board of Trade possibly to trade U.K. Long gilt futures and a
Japanese yen bond contract.
    The CBOT is now likely to proceed with an application to
trade gilts to the Commodity Futures Trading Commmission
CFTC, he said.

<TITLE>CYCLOPS ltCYL> WILL NOT GIVE DATA TO GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Cyclops Corp said its board rejected
a request by Cyacq Corp, an investor group, for more nonpublic
information about Cyclops, a maker of specialty steels and an
electronics retailer.
    Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britains
Dixons Group PLC for 90.25 dlrs a share under a tender offer
that expires midnight March 17.
    Cyacq, comprising Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors, yesterday said it
would increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs a
share from 80 dlrs, subject to certain conditions.
    The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with
nonpublic data given to Dixons and that Cyacq be satisfied
with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer.
    Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacqs
announcement was not an offer. "Cyacqs press release does not
amend Cyacqs outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs
per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing
commitments necessary to carry out its original offer or any
increased offer that it may make," Cyclops said in a statement.
    Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated
it will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts,
Cyclops said.
    The company also said it was advised that Dixons
shareholders approved the merger, satisfying that condition of
the agreement.

<TITLE>USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORNU.S. REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union has been a heavy
buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5
mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report
from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.
    Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already
been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this
sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association
reported to the U.S. official.
    In a report dated March 10, the official said that about
800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance
of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.
    An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from
JulySeptember, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav
corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.
    Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav
corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for
exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.
    Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged
around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier
estimates of 150,000, the official said.
    The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav
corn sales during this marketing year, he said.

<TITLE>REAGAN VOWS TO BLOCK TAX HIKE IN HIS PRESIDENCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan told a group of
supporters his pledge to veto a tax hike is solid, adding,
"There will be no tax rate increase in the 100th Congress."
    While he did not mention House Speaker Jim Wright by name,
Reagan said that some members of Congress were urging that
taxes be raised.
    "Im sorry but thats just not going to happen," said Reagan.
"Were not going to break faith with the American people."
    "I promise you, tax reform will go ahead as scheduled," the
president added. "All these tax hike schemes have as much chance
of flying as a dead duck," he said.
    Reagan combined his stronglystated opposition to a tax
hike with a warning to Congress to meet the deficit reduction
targets set by the GrammRudmanHollings budget control law.
    Failure to do so, he said, would jeopardize a continuation
of the current favorable economic climate.

    The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of the
producers main concerns  that the floor price, or "lower
indicative price," remain unchanged, they said.
    It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countries
will follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,
West Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,
the sources added.
    The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of
the "lower indicative price" set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore
cents a kilo in the present pact if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.
    The sources said the question of to what extent price
adjustments should be automatic remains a problem.
    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has been
holding consultations with producers and consumers throughout
the day.
    The consumers group is now holding a separate meeting
ahead of further consultations within the "presidents group"
tonight.

<DATELINE>    SPOKANE, Wash., March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Pegasus Gold Inc said it
cut its long term debt to 85 mln dlrs from 100 mln dlrs when
its European bondholders voluntarily converted some of their
debt holdings into 1.5 mln shares of Pegasus common.
    The company said the debt converted represents about 40 pct
of the total 60 mln Swiss franc convertible debentures it
completed last Fall.
    Pegasus said it began mining and processing operations at
its Zortman/Landusky Mine one month ahead of schedule.
    It completed the first phase of its 1987 Super Pad ahead of
schedule as well, allowing the mining company to load up to 7.5
mln tons of new ore on the pad. Pegasus estimated 1987
production at the Zortman/Landusky mine will be about 80,000
ounces of gold and 225,000 ounces of silver.

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD ltCAW> RESTRUCTURING SEEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg Calhoun, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc is likely to seek
out a friendly suitor or restructure operations to fight off
the unsolicited takeover offer by investor Martin Sosnoff,
securities analysts said.
    "They could be talking to a "white knight" right now," said
Janney Scott Montgomery Inc analyst Marvin Roffman, adding.
"That would be my best guess."
    Analysts also said other options for Caesars could include
a restructuring or a buyback of Sosnoffs 13.6 pct holdings.
    Earlier today, Caesars World announced that its board
unanimously rejected a 28 dlr per share, or 725.2 mln dlr,
takeover offer from MTS Acquisition Corp, a company formed by
Sosnoff.
    The company also said it will explore a variety of
alternative transactions but did not elaborate.
    In announcing the rejection, Caesars said the offer was
inadequate given the companys financial condition, future
prospects and current market conditions.
    A Caesars spokesman said the company expects to file a
14D9 with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today
with more information on its analysis of the Sosnoff offer.
    Analysts are generally bullish on the outlook for Caesars
World and some have placed the value of Caesars stock at from
32 to 35 dlrs per share.
    They have also asserted that Sosnoff is not likely to
succeed with the unsolicited bid unless he raises his offering
price to a higher level.
    Caesars Worlds stock is up 11/8 today at 291/8.
    Janney Montgomerys Roffman believes potential suitors for
the hotel/casino company could be Golden Nugget Inc ltGNG>, or
Tracinda Corp, a company controlled by investor Kirk Kirkorian.
    Golden Nugget has a good deal of cash on hand as the result
of the sale of its Atlantic City, N.J., casino to Bally
Manufacturing Corp ltBLY>, Roffman said.
    Earlier this month Golden Nugget completed its sale of the
Atlantic City property for 440 mln dlrs.
    Roffman also believes Kerkorian is interested in getting
involved in the gaming business.
    Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said
options available to Ceasars also include a restructuring in
the form of a selloff of individual properties, a stock buyback
or forming a master limited partnership.
    "Very few of these options would weaken the value of the
company," Manson said, but he declined to speculate on which
approach Caesars might take.

<TITLE>FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. February reports reflecting slim
gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
    "If youre the Fed, theres no reason to do anything," said
Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
front, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well under
control. Its an absolutely ideal situation."
    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in Januarys production
number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
less than a 0.30.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
rise in the PPI in January.
    "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said Allan
Leslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not as
bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately. Industrial
production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."
    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
    "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
barrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The
trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."
    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
decline in the PPI.
    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
    "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
today," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
could necessitate a weaker dollar.
    "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he
said. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
foreign producers."
    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
in Februarys PPI. With many electronic goods produced
overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
a large degree a 22 pct drop in the tradeweighted real value
of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
    Slifer said import prices may rise further as
manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
reflect a weaker dollar.
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
industrial output.
    "Its the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said.
"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
and they are increasing output."
    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
industrial production gain of 0.30.4 pct in the first quarter.
"Its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
beginning to revive."
    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
to a sustained rise in industrial output.
    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
February business equipment production.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
million units.
    "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
roughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparity
between output and sales is showing up in inventories."
    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
demand in the first quarter of 1987.
    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
largest monthly sales drop on record.
    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
monthtomonth changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for the
last seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to stand
pat for at least the next couple of months."

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A secondary market for resale of
farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is
gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could
be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac, industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasigovernment farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
highquality loans on farmland to "poolers," who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgagebacked securities for
resale to investors  called Aggiemae by some proponents.
    The FCA and financiallytroubled farm credit system have in
the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any
farm secondary market established in the private sector which
excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a
competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to
the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,
Naylor and farm credit system officials have said.
    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to
the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were
appointed the agent for a secondary market.
    "If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools
of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged
for providing this service," the Life Insurers study said.
    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available
to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the
system as agent, could be included in a major federal
government rescue package for the system to be drafted by
Congress later this year.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes that the farm credit systems market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established.
    The study was released earlier today.
    The study said a secondary market could be established with
virtually no federal money if the government provided a
guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private
coinsurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.
    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the
eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year
would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,
expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.
    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who
meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would
fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.
    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why
leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm
Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.
    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase
liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.

<TITLE>ECUADOR UNABLE TO SERVICE DEBT  CENTRAL BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Quito, march 13  </DATELINE><BODY>ecuador cannot service its debt owed to
private foreign banks due to the earthquake that forced a
suspension of crude oil exports, central bank officials said.
    "we hope to obtain a tacit, explicit acceptance from foreign
banks ... that we are not able to service the debt," central
bank president carlos julio emanuel said.
    "the reality is that our debt service capacity has been
totally affected by the recent cataclysm," he added in a news
conference last night.
    A central bank spokesman said emanuel was referring to
payments owed private foreign banks, already suspended since
january. These banks hold twothirds of the countrys 8.16
billion dollar foreign debt.
    Emanuel was not refering to debts to foreign governments
and multilateral organisations, the spokesman said.
    The march 5 earthquake damaged an oil pipeline, preventing
crude exports for a projected five months. Oil generates about
twothirds of ecuadors total exports and as much as 60 per
cent of the governments revenues.
    Emanuel did not specify how long ecuador would be unable
service private foreign banks. But finance minister domingo
cordovez said two days ago the government is seeking to
postpone all payments due to private foreign banks in 1987
until next year through negotiations with creditors.
    Emanuel said ecuador was seeking soft loans from
multilateral organisations for reconstruction work. It also
wanted a "reprogramming" of alreadyapproved loans, an apparent
reference to the disbursement schedule of thee credits.

<TITLE>MOBIL ltMOB> CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOWER IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray
said in the annual report issued today that the companys total
1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three
billion dlrs spent in 1986.
    "Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall
slightly below the level for 1986 although well be ready to
increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"
Murray said.
    Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures
have been cut every year since 1984s 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts "the company
has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas
reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and
Indonesia.
    Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring
of its domestic exploration and development organization and
this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which
support the new affiliate.
    "Mobils chairman has explained this change by saying we
need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our
assets," said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.
    Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which
will combine its current three exploration and producing
affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and
Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present
organization and will improve the companys upstream
competitive position.
    Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its
Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance
the development and transfer of technology supporting critical
areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and
computer systems.
    Earnings from Mobils upstream operations in 1986 were 827
mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous years 1.8 billion dlrs
in earnings.
    Mobils strategy in the exploration and production sector
will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities
with the greatest long term potential, the company said.
    In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include
greater emphasis on "frontier plays that, although riskier, fit
our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means
a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective
overseas exploration offers greater potential."

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, MARCH 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Brazils labour troubles eased a
little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing
troops from the countrys main oil installations occupied three
days ago.
    The troops went in at the request of the stateoil company
Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil
industry employees.
    Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the
withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was
calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their
willingness to negotiate a pay deal.
    A national seamens strike, however, continued and marines
remained in the countrys main ports. The marines were
despatched to the ports after the seamens strike, now two
weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.
    A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strikebound, 135
in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.
    Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport
of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their
seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.
    Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a
sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.
    Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union
leaders said the vast majority of Brazils 40,000 seamen were
still on strike.
    The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared
today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the
company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de
Janeiro next Wednesday.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.
    Besides industrial troubles, there has also been
considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.
    On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies
throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.
    Television reports showed some of these protests still
continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their
vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and
Parana.
    The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to
extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a
deterioration in its trade balance.
    On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil
was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to
private banks.
    Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and
the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.

<TITLE>MOBIL ltMOB> ADDS NATURAL GAS RESERVES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp increased net proven
reserves of natural gas liquids in 1986 from the previous year
according to data in its 1986 annual report.
    The report states that total net proved reserves at years
end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels
or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that
the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of
natural gas liquids.
    Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production
facility began operation in October with a capacity to
manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas.
    The company also said that new capacity brought onstream
last year replaced 120 pct of Mobils production, which
declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year.
    Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved
reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln
barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in
1986 from the previous year.
    Net proved crude oil reserves also fell in Canada to 224
mln barrels and in Europe to 403 mln barrels from the previous
years level of 231 mln barrels and 439 mln barrels,
respectively.

<TITLE>S/P DOWNGRADES FOUR TEXAS BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poors Corp said it
downgraded four Texas banks in a move that affects a combined
800 mln dlrs of debt securities and preferred stock.
    Cut were the debt ratings of Allied Bancshares Inc ltALBN>,
First Amarillo Bancorp Inc ltFAMA>, MCorp ltM> and Texas American
Bancshares Inc ltTXA>.

Bank of Texas, and the banks certificates of deposits, were
reduced to BBBminus and A3 from BBB and A2 respectively.
    Allied has 50 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. S and P said
its profitability remains severely depressed.
    S and P cut First Amarillos 15 mln dlrs of subordinated
debt to CCCminus from Bminus. The institutions implied
senior debt rating is CCCplus. S and P noted that First
Amarillo has had three consecutive years of losses.

BBBplus, subordinated debt to BBplus from BBB, preferred to
BBminus from BB and commercial paper to A3 from A2.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANK STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>CitiCorp ltCCI> appears to be digging
in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of
dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall
Street analysts said.
    "I view it as prenegotiation posturing," said analyst
Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both
Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on
its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first
quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it
lists the loans as nonperforming status.
    Citicorp filed an 8K form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, indicating a material change in its financial
situation. "Citicorp is saying  you cant scare us with
threats, well make your loans nonperforming right now,"
Berger said.
    The loans have to be treated as nonperforming after 90
days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation
will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.
    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by
talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between
U.S. and European banks.
    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is
unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half
of this year.
    "Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on
all the interest they owe," Cohn said. "The real issue is the
rescheduling of debt terms.
    Another question is whether or not the International
Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.
    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in
late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off
their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.
    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on
nonperforming loans are reported for each bank. But he said
investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at
present levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in the
group.
    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp ltMHC has the greatest exposure to
Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of
earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among
New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co ltJPM> and Bankers Trust
Co ltBT> which happen to have the least exposure.
    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers
Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have
lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. 
    In fact he said theres a chance those banks could get more
involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up
a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed
countries.
    "I dont see any reason to change full year earnings
estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He
thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a
situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.
    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became
nonaccruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks
came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was
paid. "What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"
he said.
    He said in the case of Brazil writeoffs of loans is a
worstcase outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that
Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through
some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to
a civilian government.
    "The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative
to their ability to service it," said John Mason of
Interstate Securities. "Weve been fiddling around with these
problems for five years and the hour is growing late."
    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut
interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of
these measures has been enough. He expects reclassification of
as much as a third of the loans as nonaccruing and he sees
partial write downs of some loans.
    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks 
could be poised for a short term rally.
    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp ltFNB> said it is
premature to put Brazils loans on a cash basis. "It is our
expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet
its debt," a spokesman said.
    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to
make a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said
much the same thing.
    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3
billion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is
subject to Brazils unilateral moratorium on repayment of
interest.

<TITLE>S/P SEES DRAMATIC GROWTH FOR ASSETBACKED DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poors Corp said it
expects the assetbacked securities market to grow dramatically
over the next few years, spurred by what it termed the
compelling benefits of secured financing.
    S and P projected the market would grow to 100 billion dlrs
in the next five years. Investment bankers say the market
currently stands at roughly 11.9 billion dlrs.
    Assets used to secure the debt included auto loans, credit
cars, computer leases and corporate loans, S and P noted. The
most active issuers to date had two main motivations, lower
costs of funding and increased financial flexibility.
    Standard and Poors pointed out that General Motors Corp
ltGM>, Chrysler Corp ltC> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd ltNSAN> realized
funding advantages by issuing car loan backed debt. But more
important, these issuers were able to increase loan volume, and
hence car sales, without substantially increasing financial
leverage, the rating agency said.
    S and P noted that Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica
Corp ltBAC>, and RepublicBank Corps ltRPT> RepublicBank Delaware
unit issued credit card backed debt and also realized lower
funding costs while mitigating increased funding and liquidity
risks resulting from weak financial performance.

<TITLE>ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Construction workers today began building
a 26 km 16 mile pipeline to link Ecuadors jungle oilfields
to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
officials said.
    They said it would take about two months and at least 15
mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombias
Pacific Ocean coast.
    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day bpd of
Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
energy ministry official said.
    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
demand.
    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
earthquake the night before.
    The tremor ruptured the countrys main pipeline from jungle
oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
Ocean.
    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the
earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the
pipeline to Balao, government officials said.
    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln
dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,
energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Departments
Export Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recent
agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global
trade talks, according to the General Accounting Office.
    GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a
Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the
cost of the European Communitys Common Agricultural Policy.
    However, there is little reason to believe that once EEP
expires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program
will be sustained in targeted markets, he said.
    Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it
acrosstheboard would eliminate charges of discrimination by
traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, but
antagonize nonsubsidizing exporters.

<TITLE>NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>A greater than anticipated need,
competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking
Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials
said.
    As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the
Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.
corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors
that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.
    First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said
recent speculation has been that last years Soviet grain crop
be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln
announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.
    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect
Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.
    Dry weather in Argentina  a major corn supplier to the
USSR  and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its
Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln
tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also
cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.
    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this
years corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln
tonnes of that booked for AprilJune delivery to the USSR.
    "Significant downside potential" still exists for the
Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the
amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.
    "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been
thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can
provide during the April to June period," he said.
    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked
Soviet buying.
    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market
earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn
for 67 dlrs  a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet
sources said.
    "This price difference makes American corn competitive,"
Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,
told Reuters.
    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause
those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn
futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have
bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.
    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the
minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains
agreement four mln tonnes, the Soviet Union may be hoping to
convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.
    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary
Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat
subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.

year, and sell it next year, after agreeing with the U.S. Air
Force to terminate the T46A trainer aircraft program.
    John Sanford, the Fairchild Republic units president and
vice president of the corporation, said Reublic will fulfill
its remaining current obligations, but will cease work on the
T46A immediately.
    Fairchild said the unit has already delivered two protoype
and one production T46A.
    Sanford said lack of additional Air Force funding for the
trainer due to budget constraints prompted the termination
agreement.
    Sanford added that without the T46A or business to replace
the work, Fairchild was forced to close the plant.
    Fairchild said it expects to retain about 200 engineers and
technicians at a small operation to be set up in 1987 on Long
Island to continue providing technical support for the Air
Forces A10 aircraft.
    Fairchild added that its Fairchild Composites/Bonding
Center, formerly a part of the Fairchild Republic operation,
will become an independent operation.
    Paul Wright, Fairchild president and chief operating
officer, said, "With the settlement of the T46A issue we have
put behind us the last of two problem aircraft programs that
caused the company heavy losses over the past two years."
    Wright added that the company can now move forward with its
restructuring to emphasize on growth areas in aerospace,
communications, electronics and its commercial and industrial
businesses.
    Earlier, Fairchild reported losses from continuing
operations in 1986s 4th qtr of 3.2 mln dlrs, or 44 cts a
share.
    This compares with a operating profit of two mln dlrs, or a
loss of eight cts a share, after subtracting the provisions for
preferred shares, in 1985s fourth quarter.
    Fairchild reported 1986 operating net of 7.6 mln dlrs, or a
loss of 34 cts a share, after provisions for preferred shares,
versus a loss of 283,000 dlrs, or 93 cts a share, in 1985.

<TITLE>BRITAIN WANTS BANK REGULATION DEAL WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13  </DATELINE><BODY>Britain wants Japan to agree a timetable
for work towards joint rules on capital adequacy for banks
along the lines of a January outline agreement between the U.S
and the U.K., Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said.
    Howard told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets
"I want to see an agreement between us on what progress is to be
made and the rate at which it will happen."
    Japanese viceminister of finance for international affairs
Toyoo Gyohten told the conference yesterday he was ready to
discuss capital adequacy, but no negotiations were planned and
he could not see how or when agreement would be reached.
    Howard said another issue he would raise during a visit to
Japan, starting on April 13, was equal access for U.K.
Financial firms to the Japanese market.
    He said 14 Londonbased financial firms were based in
Tokyo, nine of them wholly British, with licences to deal in
securities. This compared with 58 whollylicensed Japanese
firms in London.
    "I am not a protectionist. We welcome all these firms here.
But I want our firms to be able to compete just as freely in
Japan and at the moment they are not allowed to do so," he said.
